raining?
'You mocking-birds,' quoth she, 'your tunes entomb
You might behold, triumphing in their faces; 1440
Yet sometime 'Tarquin' was pronounced plain,
Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee:
Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;
'Woe, woe,' quoth Collatine, 'she was my wife,
Yet save that labour, for I have them here.
Yet neither may possess the claim they lay. 1845
Yet for the self-same purpose seek a knife:
'Yet die I will not till my Collatine
Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,
Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride 1720
With words, till action might become them better. 1375
With untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid, 1265
With too much labour drowns for want of skill. 1150
With this, they all at once began to say, 1760
'With this, I did begin to start and cry; 1690
Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,
With soft-slow tongue, true mark of modesty,
With sad attention long to hear her words.
With outward honesty, but yet defiled
With inward vice: as Priam him did cherish,
With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;
With swelling ridges; and their ranks began 1490
With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight:
With shining falchion in my chamber came
With sad set eyes, and wretched arms across,
With men's abuses: those proud lords, to blame, 1310
With head declined, and voice damm'd up with woe,
Will we find out; and there we will unfold
Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye;
'Why work'st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage,
Who, wondering at him, did his words allow:
Will slay the other and be nurse to none.
Wildly determining which way to fly,
Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness.
'Why should the private pleasure of some one
Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so, 1275
'Why hath thy servant, Opportunity,
Why art thou thus attired in discontent?
Why pry'st thou through my window? leave thy peeping: 1140
'Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?
Who wayward once, his mood with nought agrees:
Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
Whose waves to imitate the battle sought
Who nothing wants to answer her but cries, 1510
Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.
Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies;
Whose love of either to myself was nearer,
Whose deed hath made herself herself detest:
Who, mad that sorrow should his use control,
Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,
Which she too early and too late hath spill'd.'
Who, like a late-sack'd island, vastly stood
Who, if it wink, shall thereon fall and die. 1190
While thou on Tereus descant'st better skill. 1185
Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth, 1725
Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:
Who being stopp'd, the bounding banks o'erflows; 1170
While Collatine and his consorted lords 1660
While with a joyless smile she turns away
Which, thronging through her lips, so vanisheth
Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,
Which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice; 1460
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.
Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,
Which the conceited painter drew so proud,
Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black:
Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,
When with like semblance it is sympathized.
When the one pure, the other made divine? 1215
When their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces.
Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,
Which being done with speedy diligence,
Where thou was wont to rest thy weary head;
Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived? 1805
Where no excuse can give the fault amending: 1665
Wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil.
Wherein deep policy did him disguise;
Which bleeding under Pyrrhus' proud foot lies. 1500
Which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought,
When they had sworn to this advised doom, 1900
When their brave hope, bold Hector, march'd to field,
When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect
When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
When more is felt than one hath power to tell. 1340
When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.
When every part a part of woe doth bear.
When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?
'When Truth and Virtue have to do with thee,
When Tarquin did, but he was stay'd by thee.
What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;
What should I say? One of my husband's men
What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?
'What is the quality of mine offence,
We will revenge the death of this true wife.'
What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.
'Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know
We are their offspring, and they none of ours.
Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind:
True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,
Weak words, so thick come in his poor heart's aid, 1835
Wagg'd up and down, and from his lips did fly
Upon his head that hath transgressed so;
Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,
Unprofitable sounds, weak arbitrators!
Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,
'Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,
Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.'
To whom she sobbing speaks: 'O eye of eyes,
To ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow
To trembling clients be you mediators:
To those that live, and think no shame of me. 1255
True grief is fond and testy as a child, 1145
To wrong the wronger till he render right,
To wake the morn and sentinel the night,
To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,
To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.
To think their dolour others have endured.
To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,
To tame the unicorn and lion wild,
To stamp the seal of time in aged things,
To spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel,
To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,
To slay herself, that should have slain her foe.
'To show the beldam daughters of her daughter,
To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,
To shame his hope with deeds degenerate:
To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds! 1600
To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;
To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours, 995
To rouse our Roman gods with invocations,
To make him moan; but pity not his moans:
To pluck the quills from ancient ravens' wings, 1000
To plague a private sin in general? 1535
To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled,
To pencill'd pensiveness and colour'd sorrow;
To me came Tarquin armed; so beguiled 1595
To make the child a man, the man a child, 1005
To make him curse this cursed crimeful night:
To jump up higher seem'd, to mock the mind. 1465
To hide deceit, and give the harmless show
To give her so much grief and not a tongue.
To find a face where all distress is stell'd. 1495
'To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,
To feed oblivion with decay of things,
To endless date of never-ending woes?
To eat up errors by opinion bred,
To dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs,
To cheque the tears in Collatinus' eyes.
To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,
To break upon the galled shore, and than
To blot old books and alter their contents,
To all sins past, and all that are to come,
To Tarquin's everlasting banishment.
To Simois' reedy banks the red blood ran,
Time's ruin, beauty's wreck, and grim care's reign:
Time's office is to fine the hate of foes;
'Time's glory is to calm contending kings, 990
Thy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur
Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow, 1620
Till she despairing Hecuba beheld,
Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,
Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here;
'Thou wronged lord of Rome,' quoth be, 'arise:
This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,
Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire, 1655
Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps, 1625
'Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity,
Those round clear pearls of his, that move thy pity,
Thou nursest all and murder'st all that are: 980
This picture she advisedly perused,
The well-skill'd workman this mild image drew
This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear: 1525
They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.
They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence;
They buy thy help; but Sin ne'er gives a fee,
This helpless smoke of words doth me no right.
Thin winding breath, which purl'd up to the sky.
To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter
To talk in deeds, while others saucily 1400
To see the salve doth make the wound ache more;
To the poor counterfeit of her complaining: 1320
To see sad sights moves more than hear them told;
To push grief on, and back the same grief draw.
To make more vent for passage of her breath;
To live or die which of the twain were better, 1205
'To kill myself,' quoth she, 'alack, what were it,
To keep thy sharp woes waking, wretched I,
To imitate thee well, against my heart
To hide the truth of this false night's abuses:
To flatter thee with an infringed oath;
To find some desperate instrument of death:
To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.
To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:
To clear this spot by death, at least I give
To chase injustice with revengeful arms:
To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!
To accessary yieldings, but still pure
'Tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life;
'Tis double death to drown in ken of shore; 1165
'Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear: 1380
Till manly shame bids him possess his breath
Till life to death acquit my forced offence.
Till after many accents and delays, 1770
Till after a deep groan--'Tarquin from hence?'
Till Lucrece' father, that beholds her bleed,
Thy father die, and not thy father thee!
Thus cavils she with every thing she sees:
Through which I may convey this troubled soul.
Through crystal walls each little mote will peep:
Throng her inventions, which shall go before.
Threatening cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;
Thou wast not to this end from me derived.
Though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse,
Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,
Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.'
'Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;
Those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are
This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,
This said, from her be-tumbled couch she starteth,
This is too curious-good, this blunt and ill:
'This brief abridgement of my will I make:
This bastard graff shall never come to growth:
This Plot of death when sadly she had laid,
Thine, mine, his own: suppose thou dost defend me 1735
They that lose half with greater patience bear it
The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,
The weary time she cannot entertain,
The weak oppress'd, the impression of strange kinds
The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust, 1435
The stain upon his silver down will stay.
The stained taste of violated troth; 1110
The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die.
These water-galls in her dim element
These means, as frets upon an instrument,
These contraries such unity do hold,
The scalps of many, almost hid behind,
There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,
The repetition cannot make it less;
There might you see the labouring pioner
The remedy indeed to do me good
The red blood reek'd, to show the painter's strife;
The protestation stops. 'O, speak, ' quoth she,
The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,
The post attends, and she delivers it, 1385
The poison'd fountain clears itself again;
The painter was no god to lend her those;
The one will live, the other being dead:
The one doth call her his, the other his,
The old bees die, the young possess their hive: 1820
Then son and father weep with equal strife
Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again and see
Then little strength rings out the doleful knell:
Then let it not be call'd impiety, 1225
Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow;
Then call them not the authors of their ill, 1295
'Then be this all the task it hath to say
The murderous knife, and, as it left the place,
'The more to blame my sluggard negligence: 1330
The more she thought he spied in her some blemish. 1410
The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,
The moon being clouded presently is miss'd,
The mightier man, the mightier is the thing 1055
The loathsome act of lust, and so did kill
The little birds that tune their morning's joy
The lechers in their deed: this act will be
Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,
Their gentle sex to weep are often willing;
Their face their manners most expressly told:
The homely villain court'sies to her low; 1390
The heavy motion that it doth behold,
The grief away that stops his answer so: 1715
The father says 'She's mine.' 'O, mine she is,'
The face, that map which deep impression bears
The face of either cipher'd either's heart;
The dispersed air, who, holding Lucrece' life,
The deep vexation of his inward soul 1830
'The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire, 1060
The credulous old Priam after slew;
The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.'
'The baser is he, coming from a king,
The Romans plausibly did give consent 1905
That wounds my body so dishonoured.
That with my nails her beauty I may tear.
That was not forced; that never was inclined
That two red fires in both their faces blazed; 1405
That through their light joy seemed to appear, 1485
That thou art doting father of his fruit. 1115
That they will suffer these abominations,
That she with painted images hath spent;
That she her plaints a little while doth stay,
That she concludes the picture was belied.
That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent:
That patience is quite beaten from her breast.
That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.
That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.
That no man could distinguish what he said.
That my poor beauty had purloin'd his eyes;
That mother tries a merciless conclusion
That makes him honour'd, or begets him hate;
'That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.
That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,
That jealousy itself could not mistrust
That it beguiled attention, charm'd the sight: 1455
That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine, 1230
That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.'
That guides this hand to give this wound to me.'
That for Achilles' image stood his spear, 1475
That dying fear through all her body spread;
That cannot tread the way out readily;
That blushing red no guilty instance gave,
That blow did that it from the deep unrest
That I no more can see what once I was! 1815
Than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion. 1210
Th' adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom.
Teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill!
Swift subtle post, carrier of grisly care,
Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
Swearing, unless I took all patiently,
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill; 1050
Such sweet observance in this work was had,
Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,
Such harmless creatures have a true respect
'Such devils steal effects from lightless hell;
Such danger to resistance did belong,
Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
Stood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy
Stood for the whole to be imagined.
Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew;
Stone-still, astonish'd with this deadly deed,
Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
Staring on Priam's wounds with her old eyes,
Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
Speaking to those that came with Collatine, 1740
So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan, 1415
So with herself is she in mutiny,
So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
So should my shame still rest upon record,
So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,
So of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred;
So must my soul, her bark being peel'd away. 1220
So mild, that Patience seem'd to scorn his woes.
Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
Some present speed to come and visit me.
Some of her blood still pure and red remain'd,
Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
Some happy mean to end a hapless life.
Some dark deep desert, seated from the way, 1195
So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill:
So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.
So am I now: O no, that cannot be; 1100
So Priam's trust false Sinon's tears doth flatter,
So Lucrece, set a-work, sad tales doth tell
So, I commend me from our house in grief: 1360
So I at each sad strain will strain a tear,
Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame, 1085
Since that my case is past the help of law.
Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.'
Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,
Shows me a bare-boned death by time out-worn:
'Show me the strumpet that began this stir,
Show'd life imprison'd in a body dead.
Show'd deep regard and smiling government.
Short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining:
She would request to know your heaviness.' 1335
She would have said 'can lurk in such a look;'
She utters this, 'He, he, fair lords, 'tis he,
She throws her eyes about the painting round, 1550
She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,
She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails, 1615
She modestly prepares to let them know
She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,
She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow.
She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her: 1370
Shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife:
She dares not thereof make discovery,
Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.
Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment.
Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
'Shall plight your honourable faiths to me,
Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.'
Seeing such emulation in their woe,
Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused; 1580
Sad souls are slain in merry company;
Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
Revealing day through every cranny spies,
Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
Replies her husband: 'do not take away
Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
Receives the scroll without or yea or no,
Promise more speed, but do it leisurely:
Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?
Poor women's faults, that they are so fulfill'd
Poor women's faces are their own fault's books.
'Poor instrument,' quoth she,'without a sound, 1515
Poor helpless help, the treasure stol'n away,
'Poor hand, why quiver'st thou at this decree?
Poor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day:
'Poor broken glass, I often did behold
Poor Lucrece' cheeks unto her maid seem so
Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.
Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.
Pale cowards, marching on with trembling paces;
Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
'Out, idle words, servants to shallow fools!
'O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,
O, this dread night, wouldst thou one hour come back,
'O, that is gone for which I sought to live,
'O, teach me how to make mine own excuse!
Or that which from discharged cannon fumes.
Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,
Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,
Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms. 1570
Or at the least this refuge let me find; 1705
'O,' quoth Lucretius,' I did give that life
'O, peace!' quoth Lucrece: 'if it should be told,
Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes, 1555
On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,
On thee and thine this night I will inflict,
Only to flatter fools and make them bold: 1610
One poor retiring minute in an age
One justly weeps; the other takes in hand
Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes; 1545
Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
O, hear me then, injurious, shifting Time!
Of what she was no semblance did remain:
Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,
Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,
Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me.
Of that polluted prison where it breathed:
Of that black blood a watery rigol goes,
Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.
Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,
Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry, 1575
Of present death, and shame that might ensue
Of physiognomy might one behold!
Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her
Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.
'O Time, thou tutor both to good and bad,
Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.
'Now, by the Capitol that we adore,
Not that devour'd, but that which doth devour,
Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.
Nor why her fair cheeks over-wash'd with woe.
'Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,
Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:
No rightful plea might plead for justice there: 1700
Nor fold my fault in cleanly-coin'd excuses;
Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.
No object but her passion's strength renews;
'No, no,' quoth she, 'no dame, hereafter living, 1765
No more than wax shall be accounted evil
No man inveigh against the wither'd flower, 1305
No cause, but company, of her drops spilling:
My woe too sensible thy passion maketh
My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.'
My tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,
My stained blood to Tarquin I'll bequeath,
My soul and body to the skies and ground; 1250
My sorrow's interest; let no mourner say
My shame so dead, mine honour is new-born.
My shame be his that did my fame confound;
Myself was stirring ere the break of day,
Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,
My sable ground of sin I will not paint, 1125
My restless discord loves no stops nor rests; 1175
My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
My resolution, husband, do thou take;
My low-declined honour to advance?
My life's foul deed, my life's fair end shall free it.
'My honour I'll bequeath unto the knife 1235
'My girl,' quoth she, 'on what occasion break
My fame and thy perpetual infamy.'
'My daughter' and 'my wife' with clamours fill'd 1855
'My body or my soul, which was the dearer,
My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
My Collatine would else have come to me
Much like a press of people at a door,
More feeling-painful: let it then suffice 1730
Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping:
'Mis-shapen Time, copesmate of ugly Night,
Mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound;
'Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,
Met far from home, wondering each other's chance.
May my pure mind with the foul act dispense, 1755
May any terms acquit me from this chance?
Many she sees where cares have carved some,
Many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear,
Making such sober action with his hand,
Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.
Make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair: 1180
Make her moans mad with their sweet melody:
'Madam, ere I was up,' replied the maid,
Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
'Look, look, how listening Priam wets his eyes,
Longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd.
'Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,
Lo, here, the hopeless merchant of this loss,
Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling: 1285
Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.
Like bright things stain'd, a kind of heavy fear.
Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still,
Life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny. 1780
Let there bechance him pitiful mischances,
Let sin, alone committed, light alone
Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool, 1870
'Let him have time to tear his curled hair,
'Let him have time to see his friends his foes,
Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
Let him have time to live a loathed slave, 1035
Let him have time of Time's help to despair,
Let him have time against himself to rave,
Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe:
Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright;
Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow:
Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends: 1015
Lays open all the little worms that creep;
Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood: 1325
Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies' harms.' 1745
Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.'
I will not wrong thy true affection so,
'I will not poison thee with my attaint,
It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
'It cannot be' she in that sense forsook,
'It cannot be,' quoth she,'that so much guile'-- 1585
Is worthy blame. O, let it not be hild
Is to let forth my foul-defiled blood. 1080
Is it revenge to give thyself a blow
I should not live to speak another word;
Is form'd in them by force, by fraud, or skill:
I owed her, and 'tis mine that she hath kill'd.'
In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;
'In vain,' quoth she, 'I live, and seek in vain 1095
In vain I spurn at my confirm'd despite:
'In vain I rail at Opportunity,
In vain I cavil with mine infamy,
In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood
Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,
In time of sorrow, and how swift and short
In thy sweet semblance my old age new born; 1810
In such relenting dew of lamentations; 1880
In speech, it seem'd, his beard, all silver white,
In scorn of nature, art gave lifeless life:
In rage sent out, recall'd in rage, being past:
In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain 1300
In me moe woes than words are now depending;
In him the painter labour'd with his skill
In her the painter had anatomized
In great commanders grace and majesty
In Ajax' eyes blunt rage and rigor roll'd;
In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art 1445
Immaculate and spotless is my mind;
Imagine every eye beholds their blame; 1395
I'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue;
I'll murder straight, and then I'll slaughter thee 1685
If thou my love's desire do contradict.
If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining,
If they surcease to be that should survive.
If tears could help, mine own would do me good.
If in this blemish'd fort I make some hole
If in the child the father's image lies,
If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see--
I fear'd by Tarquin's falchion to be slain,
If children predecease progenitors,
I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!
How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!
'How may this forced stain be wiped from me?
How Tarquin must be used, read it in me:
Honour thyself to rid me of this shame:
Holds disputation with each thing she views,
His time of folly and his time of sport;
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
His nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear;
His leaves will wither and his sap decay;
His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
His face, though full of cares, yet show'd content;
His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;
Himself on her self-slaughter'd body threw;
Himself himself seek every hour to kill!
He with the Romans was esteemed so
He weeps for her, for she was only mine,
He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,
Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly
Her sacred temple spotted, spoil'd, corrupted,
Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow, 1270
Her mansion batter'd by the enemy;
Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,
Her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.
Her letter now is seal'd, and on it writ
'Her house is sack'd, her quiet interrupted,
Her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe;
Her grief, but not her grief's true quality: 1365
Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
Here one man's hand lean'd on another's head,
Here one being throng'd bears back, all boll'n and red;
Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds,
Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,
Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,
Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
Her earnest eye did make him more amazed:
Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd
Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy 1280
Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.
Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
Her blue blood changed to black in every vein, 1505
Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;
Held back his sorrow's tide, to make it more; 1840
He hath no power to ask her how she fares: 1645
He gratis comes; and thou art well appaid 965
He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,
He entertain'd a show so seeming just, 1565
He doth again repeat, and that they swore.
Health to thy person! next vouchsafe t' afford--
Have time to wail th' abusing of his time. 1045
Have heard the cause of my untimely death;
Hath thee befall'n, that thou dost trembling stand? 1650
Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;
Had doting Priam cheque'd his son's desire,
Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
Guilty of perjury and subornation, 970
Guilty of incest, that abomination;
Grossly engirt with daring infamy:
Griped in an armed hand; himself, behind,
Grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts,
Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.
Grief best is pleased with grief's society:
Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
'Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen:
Gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly, 1065
Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
From what is past: the help that thou shalt lend me
From the creation to the general doom. 975
From that suspicion which the world might bear her.
From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free. 1675
From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow
For why her face wore sorrow's livery;
For who so base would such an office have
For 'tis a meritorious fair design
For then eye interprets to the ear
For sportive words and uttering foolish things:
For sparing justice feeds iniquity.
For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,
'For some hard-favour'd groom of thine,' quoth he,
For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:
For perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story
For one's offence why should so many fall,
For now 'tis stale to sigh, to weep, and groan:
For much imaginary work was there;
For me, I force not argument a straw,
'For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,
For me, I am the mistress of my fate, 1120
For more it is than I can well express:
For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy; 1160
For men have marble, women waxen, minds,
For if I die, my honour lives in thee;
For in my death I murder shameful scorn: 1240
For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds? 1875
For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.
Foretell new storms to those already spent. 1640
For day hath nought to do what's done by night.'
For Lucrece thought he blush'd to her see shame:
'Fool, fool!' quoth she, 'his wounds will not be sore.'
For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.
For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds:
'For even as subtle Sinon here is painted.
For burden-wise I'll hum on Tarquin still,
For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,
For Helen's rape the city to destroy,
First hovering o'er the paper with her quill:
'Few words,' quoth she, 'Shall fit the trespass best,
False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust
Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say 'So be it:' 1260
Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
Even so this pattern of the worn-out age
Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
Even so his sighs, his sorrows, make a saw,
Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
Each present lord began to promise aid,
Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
Doth in her poison'd closet yet endure.' 1710
'Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances, 1025
Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
Disdain to him disdained scraps to give.
Devise extremes beyond extremity, 1020
Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,
Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters; 1070
'Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
'Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,
Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed 1670
'Daughter, dear daughter,' old Lucretius cries,
'Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart
Corrupted blood some watery token shows;
Continuance tames the one; the other wild,
Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,
Conceit and grief an eager combat fight; 1350
Comparing him to that unhappy guest
Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die;
'Come, Philomel, that sing'st of ravishment,
Circles her body in on every side, 1790
Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so
Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep:
By this, starts Collatine as from a dream,
By this short schedule Collatine may know
By this, lamenting Philomel had ended 1130
By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased. 1885
By whose example thou revenged mayest be. 1245
By my excuse shall claim excuse's giving.'
Cancell'd my fortunes, and enchained me 985
By this, mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak
By that her death, to do her husband wrong: 1315
By heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's store,
By foul enforcement might be done to me,
By deep surmise of others' detriment; 1630
By all our country rights in Rome maintain'd,
But, wretched as he is, he strives in vain;
But with my body my poor soul's pollution?
But when I fear'd I was a loyal wife:
But through his teeth, as if the name he tore.
But thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth 1090
But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent 1450
'But tell me, girl, when went'--and there she stay'd
But such a face should bear a wicked mind.
But she, that yet her sad task hath not said, 1750
But now the mindful messenger, come back,
But now that fresh fair mirror, dim and old,
But now he throws that shallow habit by, 1865
But none where all distress and dolour dwell'd,
But more than 'he' her poor tongue could not speak;
But long she thinks till he return again,
But little stars may hide them when they list.
But, like a constant and confirmed devil,
'But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,
But kneel with me and help to bear thy part,
But if the like the snow-white swan desire,
But if I live, thou livest in my defame:
'But ere I name him, you fair lords,' quoth she,
But eagles gazed upon with every eye.
But durst not ask of her audaciously
But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see, 1135
But chide rough winter that the flower hath kill'd:
But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,
But Tarquin's shape came in her mind the while,
Busy yourselves in skill-contending schools;
Burying in Lucrece' wound his folly's show.
Brutus, who pluck'd the knife from Lucrece' side,
Brings home his lord and other company; 1635
Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,
Both stood, like old acquaintance in a trance,
Blushing at that which is so putrified.
Blue circles stream'd; like rainbows in the sky:
Bid thou be ready, by and by, to bear
Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;
Betray'd the hours thou gavest me to repose,
Be suddenly revenged on my foe,
Besides, the life and feeling of her passion
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
Being constrain'd with dreadful circumstance?
Be guilty of my death, since of my crime.
Begrimed with sweat, and smeared all with dust;
Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng
Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending;
Began to clothe his wit in state and pride, 1860
Before the which is drawn the power of Greece. 1420
Become the public plague of many moe? 1530
Base watch of woes, sin's pack-horse, virtue's snare;
Basely with gold, but stol'n from forth thy gate.
Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.
A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
At this request, with noble disposition
Back to the strait that forced him on so fast;
Ay me! the bark peel'd from the lofty pine,
At length address'd to answer his desire,
At last she thus begins: 'Thou worthy lord 1355
At last she smilingly with this gives o'er;
At last she sees a wretched image bound,
At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
At last it rains, and busy winds give o'er:
At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,
A thousand lamentable objects there, 1425
A thousand crosses keep them from thy aid:
At his own shadow let the thief run mad,
At Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful Night; 1075
'At Ardea to my lord with more than haste.'
As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow.
As well to hear as grant what he hath said.
As 'twere encouraging the Greeks to fight;
A stranger came, and on that pillow lay
As through an arch the violent roaring tide
As the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze, 1200
As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,
As smoke from AEtna, that in air consumes,
As slanderous death's-man to so base a slave?
As silly-jeering idiots are with kings,
As shaming any eye should thee behold,
Assail'd by night with circumstances strong
As lagging fowls before the northern blast:
As if with grief or travail he had fainted,
As if some mermaid did their ears entice,
As heaven, it seem'd, to kiss the turrets bow'd.
As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,
As, but for loss of Nestor's golden words,
Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city. 1605
A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,
Answer'd their cries, 'my daughter' and 'my wife.'
An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,
And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long;
And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes 1520
And with deep groans the diapason bear;
And why not I from this compelled stain?'
As bound in knighthood to her imposition,
Another smother'd seems to pelt and swear;
Another power; no flood by raining slaketh.
And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.
And with my trespass never will dispense,
And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,
And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament.
And who cannot abuse a body dead?
'And whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part,
And when the judge is robb'd the prisoner dies.
And what wrong else may be imagined
And waste huge stones with little water drops. 1010
And wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe,
And unperceived fly with the filth away;
And turn the giddy round of Fortune's wheel;
And turn'd it thus,' It cannot be, I find, 1590
And to their hope they such odd action yield,
And to his protestation urged the rest, 1895
And to herself all sorrow doth compare;
And time to see one that by alms doth live
And time doth weary time with her complaining.
And thus begins: 'What uncouth ill event
And therefore now I need not fear to die.
And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,
And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.
And therein so ensconced his secret evil,
And therefore still in night would cloister'd be.
And therefore are they form'd as marble will;
And that deep torture may be call'd a hell
And then in key-cold Lucrece' bleeding stream 1825
And the dire thought of his committed evil
And that deep vow, which Brutus made before,
And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts. 1290
And then against my heart he sets his sword,
And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.'
And swear I found you where you did fulfil
And still on him she gazed; and gazing still,
And so to publish Tarquin's foul offence:
And sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow,
And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words.
And some look'd black, and that false Tarquin stain'd.
And solemn night with slow sad gait descended
And softly cried 'Awake, thou Roman dame,
And smear with dust their glittering golden towers;
And shivered all the beauty of my glass,
And shapes her sorrow to the beldam's woes,
And seems to point her out where she sits weeping;
And round about her tear-stained eye
And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong;
And only must be wail'd by Collatine.' 1850
And one man's lust these many lives confounds: 1540
And now this pale swan in her watery nest
And never be forgot in mighty Rome 1695
And my laments would be drawn out too long,
And merry fools to mock at him resort; 1040
And live to be revenged on her death.
And little stars shot from their fixed places,
And let mild women to him lose their mildness, 1030
And leave the faltering feeble souls alive?
And kiss'd the fatal knife, to end his vow;
And in their rage such signs of rage they bear, 1470
And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell;
And in my hearing be you mute and dumb:
And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:
And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,
And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy 1480
And from the towers of Troy there would appear
And from the strand of Dardan, where they fought,
And from the purple fountain Brutus drew 1785
And from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took:
And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,
And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.
'And for, poor bird, thou sing'st not in the day,
'And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,
And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.
And far the weaker with so strong a fear:
And ever since, as pitying Lucrece' woes,
And ever let his unrecalling crime
And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away.
And entertain my love; else lasting shame 1680
And dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights, 1430
And drop sweet balm in Priam's painted wound,
And counterfeits to die with her a space;
And chid the painter for his wondrous skill,
And by this chaste blood so unjustly stain'd,
And by chaste Lucrece' soul that late complain'd 1890
And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide
And both she thinks too long with her remaining:
And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed;
And, blushing on her, with a steadfast eye
And blood untainted still doth red abide, 1800
And bitter words to ban her cruel foes:
And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;
And as one shifts, another straight ensues: 1155
And as his due writ in my testament.
And arm'd his long-hid wits advisedly,
And all my fame that lives disbursed be
An accessary by thine inclination
Amazedly in her sad face he stares:
All jointly listening, but with several graces,
A letter to my lord, my love, my dear; 1345
A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed: 1775
A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,
Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;
A dying life to living infamy:
A creeping creature, with a flaming light,
About the mourning and congealed face 1795
About him were a press of gaping faces,
A brow unbent, that seem'd to welcome woe; 1560
Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?
A badge of fame to slander's livery; 1105
Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,
'Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive,
Writ in the glassy margents of such books:
Yield to my love; if not, enforced hate,
Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,
Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;
With your uncleanness that which is divine;
With such black payment as thou hast pretended;
'With rotten damps ravish the morning air;
With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night:
Within his thought her heavenly image sits,
With honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;
With heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace,
With foul offenders thou perforce must bear,
With close-tongued treason and the ravisher!
With bruised arms and wreaths of victory:
Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,
Will he not wake, and in a desperate rage
'Why hunt I then for colour or excuses?
Who with a lingering slay his course doth let,
Who this accomplishment so hotly chased;
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
Whose inward ill no outward harm express'd:
Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;
Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.
Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame?
While in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth:
Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?
Which struck her sad, and then it faster rock'd,
Who, flatter'd by their leader's jocund show,
Who fears a sentence or an old man's saw
While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.
While Lust is in his pride, no exclamation
Which with a yielding latch, and with no more,
Which to her oratory adds more grace.
Which once corrupted takes the worser part;
Which in her prescience she controlled still,
Whether it is that she reflects so bright,
Which in a moment doth confound and kill
Which, having all, all could not satisfy;
Which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding,
Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon
Which far exceeds his barren skill to show:
Which Tarquin view'd in her fair face's field,
Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye;
Which drives the creeping thief to some regard:
Where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look.
'Where now I have no one to blush with me,
Where, like a virtuous monument, she lies,
Where, lest between them both it should be kill'd,
Where her beloved Collatinus lies.
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer,
Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,
When thus thy vices bud before thy spring!
When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?
When they in thee the like offences prove:
When shall he think to find a stranger just,
When, pattern'd by thy fault, foul sin may say,
When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.
When he himself himself confounds, betrays
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes:
'What win I, if I gain the thing I seek?
What following sorrow may on this arise:
What darest thou not when once thou art a king?
'Were Tarquin Night, as he is but Night's child,
Vast sin-concealing chaos! nurse of blame!
Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
Upon the world dim darkness doth display,
Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel.'
Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
Unto a view so false will not incline;
Until her husband's welfare she did hear;
Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,
'Tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,
Turns not, but swells the higher by this let.
True valour still a true respect should have;
To wish that I their father had not bin.
To wink, being blinded with a greater light:
To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares,
To view thy present trespass in another.
To those two armies that would let him go,
To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls' haste
'To thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,
To strike a poor unseasonable doe.
To soften it with their continual motion;
To slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days?
To privilege dishonour in thy name?
To mask their brows and hide their infamy; 845
To living death and pain perpetual:
To have their unseen sin remain untold;
To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.
To darken her whose light excelleth thine:
To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,
To cloak offences with a cunning brow.
To cipher me how fondly I did dote;
To be thy partner in this shameful doom.'
To ask the spotted princess how she fares.
To all the host of heaven I complain me,
Till every minute pays the hour his debt.
Thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed,
withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent
whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife
was, according to his estate, royally entertained and lodged by
they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the

the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of
the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a
that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds
supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife: among
revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and
possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons
people were so moved, that with one consent and a general
of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her
not requiring or staying for the people's suffrages, had
maids: the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or
intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of
in several disports. Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus
his wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her
his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the
government changed from kings to consuls.
To be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes.
To add a more rejoicing to the prime,
Till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd
Till sable Night, mother of Dread and Fear,
Till like a jade Self-will himself doth tire.
Thyself art mighty; for thine own sake leave me:
Thy princely office how canst thou fulfil,
morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight,
into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the
hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father,
cruelly murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs,
camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and
another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one
and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause
accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius;
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight;
bitter invective against the tyranny of the king: wherewith the
and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea. During which siege
acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state
after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be
Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy.'
Yea the illiterate, that know not how
Yet for thy honour did I entertain him;
'Yet am I guilty of thy honour's wrack;
Wrath, envy, treason, rape, and murder's rages, 960
Wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears,
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
Worse than a slavish wipe or birth-hour's blot:
With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells.
With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.
With pearly sweat, resembling dew of night.
Without the bed her other fair hand was,
With more than admiration he admired
Within whose face beauty and virtue strived
Will tie the hearers to attend each line,
Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.
Will couple my reproach to Tarquin's shame;
'Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud?
Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,
Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking;
Whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies:
Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
Who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,
Who, like a foul ursurper, went about
Who in their pride do presently abuse it: 915
Whoever plots the sin, thou 'point'st the season; 930
Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
While she, the picture of pure piety,
Which virtue gave the golden age to gild
Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak
Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight,
Which of them both should underprop her fame:
Which not themselves, but he that gives them knows!
Which, like a falcon towering in the skies,
Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire
Which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show;
Which I to conquer sought with all my might;
Where thou with patience must my will abide;
Where their dear governess and lady lies,
Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties,
When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end? 950
'When wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend,
When virtue is profaned in such a devil!
When virtue bragg'd, beauty would blush for shame;
When shame assail'd, the red should fence the white.
When beauty boasted blushes, in despite
When at Collatium this false lord arrived,
When Collatine unwisely did not let
What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;
What virtue breeds iniquity devours:
What terror or 'tis! but she, in worser taking,
What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
What needeth then apologies be made,
What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,
What did he note but strongly he desired?
What could he see but mightily he noted?
Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame,
We have no good that we can say is ours,
Virtue would stain that o'er with silver white.
Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers;
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
'Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring; 920
Unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;
Under what colour he commits this ill.
Under that colour am I come to scale
To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,
To set forth that which is so singular?
To praise the clear unmatched red and white
To make the breach and enter this sweet city.
To kill thine honour with thy life's decay;
To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long.
To sound a parley to his heartless foe;
To quench the coal which in his liver glows.
To cipher what is writ in learned books,
'Tis thou that spurn'st at right, at law, at reason;
'Tis thou that executest the traitor's treason:
Till they might open to adorn the day.
Thy violent vanities can never last. 945
Thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste:
Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name,
'Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,
Thy private feasting to a public fast,
Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,
Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,
Thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy:
Thy honey turns to gall, thy joy to grief! 940
Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages.
Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.
Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried;
Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,
Those that much covet are with gain so fond,
Throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm;
Through little vents and crannies of the place
Thou wrong'st his honour, wound'st his princely name.
Thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;
Thou look'st not like deceit; do not deceive me.
Thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same,
Through Night's black bosom should not peep again:
Thou see'st our mistress' ornaments are chaste.'
Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining:
Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed.
Th' one sweetly flatters, th' other feareth harm;
This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.
This said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,
This heraldry in Lucrece' face was seen,
This earthly saint, adored by this devil,
Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!
Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,
Thus he replies: 'The colour in thy face,
Thus, graceless, holds he disputation
'Thus I forestall thee, if thou mean to chide:
Thou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave:
Thou smother'st honesty, thou murder'st troth;
Thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get;
Thou ravisher, thou traitor, thou false thief,
Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud:
Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;
'Thou makest the vestal violate her oath;
Thou loathed in their shame, they in thy pride:
Thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds:
This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,
'Thou art,' quoth she, 'a sea, a sovereign king;
This siege that hath engirt his marriage,
Thou blow'st the fire when temperance is thaw'd; 935
Thou foul abettor! thou notorious bawd!
This momentary joy breeds months of pain;
This forced league doth force a further strife;
This said, he sets his foot upon the light,
This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
This hot desire converts to cold disdain:
This dying virtue, this surviving shame,
'This deed will make thee only loved for fear;
This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,
This bateless edge on his keen appetite;
'Think but how vile a spectacle it were,
'They think not but that every eye can see
They scatter and unloose it from their bond,
They, mustering to the quiet cabinet
They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.
The worst is but denial and reproving:
The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries;
The wind wars with his torch to make him stay,
The threshold grates the door to have him heard;
The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,
The things we are for that which we expect;
The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;
The story of sweet chastity's decay,
The spots whereof could weeping purify,
The sovereignty of either being so great,
The silver-shining queen he would distain;
The silly lambs: pure thoughts are dead and still,
The sight which makes supposed terror true.
The shame that from them no device can take,
The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;
The scornful mark of every open eye;
The scar that will, despite of cure, remain;
The same disgrace which they themselves behold;
Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe
The reason of this rash alarm to know,
The prey wherein by nature they delight;
The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact,
The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee;
The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
The petty streams that pay a daily debt
'The patient dies while the physician sleeps; 955
The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds;
The orator, to deck his oratory,
Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?'
Then white as lawn, the roses took away.
Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?
Then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red,
'The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story,
Then my digression is so vile, so base,
Then looking scornfully, he doth despise
Then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.
The niggard prodigal that praised her so,--
Then had they seen the period of their ill;
'Then, for thy husband and thy children's sake,
'Then, childish fear, avaunt! debating, die!
'Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide!
Then Collatine again, by Lucrece' side,
The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.'
The locks between her chamber and his will,
The light will show, character'd in my brow,
The life of purity, the supreme fair,
The lesser thing should not the greater hide;
Their silver cheeks, and call'd it then their shield;
Their silent war of lilies and of roses,
Their own transgressions partially they smother:
Their father was too weak, and they too strong,
The impious breach of holy wedlock vow: 860
The guilty rebel for remission prays.
The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;
The flesh being proud, Desire doth fight with Grace,
The fault unknown is as a thought unacted;
The eyes of men without an orator;
The eye of heaven is out, and misty night
The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch:
The doors, the wind, the glove, that did delay him,
The death of all, and all together lost.
The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,
The curtains being close, about he walks,
The coward captive vanquished doth yield
The branches of another root are rotted,
The blackest sin is clear'd with absolution;
The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece' bed.
The coward fights and will not be dismay'd.
The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,
The blemish that will never be forgot;
The aim of all is but to nurse the life
'The aged man that coffers-up his gold
The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing;
The Rape of Lucrece
The Argument
That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed.
That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.
That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
That through the length of times he stands disgraced:
That thou shalt see thy state and pity mine.'
That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,
That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain.
That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed.
That some impurity doth not pollute. 905
That shuts him from the heaven of his thought,
That one for all, or all for one we gage;
That oft they interchange each other's seat.
That now he vows a league, and now invasion.
That nothing in him seem'd inordinate,
That my posterity, shamed with the note
That kings might be espoused to more fame,
That it will live engraven in my face.
That is as clear from this attaint of mine
That in their smoky ranks his smother'd light
That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,
That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,
That golden hap which their superiors want.
That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!
That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;
That for his prey to pray he doth begin,
That eye which looks on her confounds his wits;
That eye which him beholds, as more divine,
That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.
That even for anger makes the lily pale,
That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee
That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;
That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more.
That all the faults which in thy reign are made 855
Tender my suit: bequeath not to their lot
Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining.
Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,
Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted
Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece' beauty, yet smothering
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries;
Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting:
That done, some worthless slave of thine I'll slay,
Suggested this proud issue of a king;
Swearing I slew him, seeing thee embrace him.
Stuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours;
So under his insulting falchion lies
'So thy surviving husband shall remain
'So then he hath it when he cannot use it,
So that in venturing ill we leave to be
So surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night:
So should I have co-partners in my pain; 840
'So shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave;
So o'er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,
'So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state'--
So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,
'So, so,' quoth he, 'these lets attend the time,
Some purer chest to close so pure a mind.
Soft pity enters at an iron gate.
So from himself impiety hath wrought,
So fares it with this faultful lord of Rome,
So cross him with their opposite persuasion,
So Lucrece must I force to my desire.'
So guiltless she securely gives good cheer
Smoking with pride, march'd on to make his stand
She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;
Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,
She there remains a hopeless castaway;
Small lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide,
Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.
Showing life's triumph in the map of death,
She wakes her heart by beating on her breast,
She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
She says, her subjects with foul insurrection
Since thou art guilty of my cureless crime,
Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,
She, much amazed, breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes,
She puts the period often from his place;
She prays she never may behold the day,
Shame folded up in blind concealing night,
She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
'Shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known:
She like a wearied lamb lies panting there;
She, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear;
She bears the load of lust he left behind,
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin
Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe.'
Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son, in their discourses after
Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine,
Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.
Save something too much wonder of his eye,
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,
Sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage;
Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;
Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!--
Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face, 880
Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;
Reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate,
Rather than triumph in so false a foe.
Quoth she, 'Reward not hospitality
Quoth he, 'She took me kindly by the hand,
Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes:
Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch:
Proving from world's minority their right:
Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?
Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;
Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.
Pleads, in a wilderness where are no laws,
Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,
Perchance his boast of Lucrece' sovereignty
Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.
Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;
Pain pays the income of each precious thing;
'O, what excuse can my invention make,
'O unseen shame! invisible disgrace!
O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!
'O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!
Or why is Collatine the publisher
Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
Or were he not my dear friend, this desire
Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts?
Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
Or sells eternity to get a toy?
Or lain in ambush to betray my life,
Or kings be breakers of their own behests?
Or kills his life or else his quality.
Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests? 900
Or, gaining more, the profit of excess
Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain'd?
Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,
O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
On the green coverlet; whose perfect white
Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,
On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;
O modest wantons! wanton modesty!
O impious act, including all foul harms!
O, if no harder than a stone thou art,
O, how her fear did make her colour rise!
'O hateful, vaporous, and foggy Night!
O, had they in that darksome prison died!
O, how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!
Of that we have: so then we do neglect
Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:
Of either's colour was the other queen,
Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste.
O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
'O comfort-killing Night, image of hell!
O, be remember'd, no outrageous thing
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting,
'O Opportunity, thy guilt is great!
'O Night, thou furnace of foul-reeking smoke, 850
Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,--
Now stole upon the time the dead of night,
Now serves the season that they may surprise
Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;
Now is he come unto the chamber-door,
Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier:
Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies
Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,
Nor children's tears nor mothers' groans respecting,
Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.
No penetrable entrance to her plaining:
No noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries;
No more,' quoth he; 'by heaven, I will not hear thee:
No comfortable star did lend his light,
No cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
Night-wandering weasels shriek to see him there;
Neglected all, with swift intent he goes
My will that marks thee for my earth's delight,
My will is strong, past reason's weak removing.
My will is back'd with resolution:
My sighs, like whirlwinds, labour hence to heave thee:
Myself a weakling; do not then ensnare me:
My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
'My husband is thy friend; for his sake spare me:
My honour lost, and I, a drone-like bee,
My heart shall never countermand mine eye:
Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight.
Must he in thee read lectures of such shame?
Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light,
Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee;
More than his eyes were open'd to the light.
Mingling my talk with tears, my grief with groans,
Mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?
Might have excuse to work upon his wife,
Men's faults do seldom to themselves appear;
Melt at my tears, and be compassionate!
May set at noon and make perpetual night. 835
May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade!
Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they posted to Rome; and
'Make me not object to the tell-tale Day!
Mar not the thing that cannot be amended;
May feel her heart-poor citizen!--distress'd,
Make war against proportion'd course of time; 825
Make something nothing by augmenting it.
Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk
Made glorious by his manly chivalry
Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:
'Lucrece,' quoth he,'this night I must enjoy thee:
Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth
Lucius Tarquinius, for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus,
Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth:
Look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,
Look, as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,
Little suspecteth the false worshipper;
Like to a new-kill'd bird she trembling lies;
Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case:
Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
Like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws,
Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
Let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick 830
Let not the jealous Day behold that face
'Let my good name, that senseless reputation,
Let him return, and flattering thoughts retire:
Let fair humanity abhor the deed
Left there round turrets destitute and pale.
Leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain.
Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head.
Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
Justice is feasting while the widow weeps;
I think the honey guarded with a sting;
I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;
Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits;
Is not inured; return again in haste;
Is madly toss'd between desire and dread;
'I see what crosses my attempt will bring;
Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,
Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,
In the remorseless wrinkles of his face;
Intending weariness with heavy spright;
Instead of love's coy touch, shall rudely tear thee;
In thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept, 890
In the possession of his beauteous mate;
In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;
In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,
In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.
In his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding,
In his clear bed might have reposed still:
In having much, torments us with defect
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.
In bloody death and ravishment delighting,
In a pure compound; being so applied,
'In Tarquin's likeness I did entertain thee:
Immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace!
Imagine her as one in dead of night
I'll beg her love; but she is own:
I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
I know repentant tears ensue the deed,
'I have debated, even in my soul,
If thou deny, then force must work my way,
If that be made a theme for disputation,
If in thy hope thou darest do such outrage,
If ever man were moved with woman moans,
If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
If all these pretty ills shall change thy good,
'If Collatinus dream of my intent,
'If, Collatine, thine honour lay in me, 885
Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands,
'How will thy shame be seeded in thine age,
How he in peace is wounded, not in war.
How comes it then, vile Opportunity,
How can they then assist me in the act?
How Tarquin wronged me, I Collatine. 870
Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost
Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,
His wonted height, yet ere he go to bed,
His venom in effect is purified.
His true respect will prison false desire,
His taste delicious, in digestion souring,
His rage of lust by gazing qualified;
His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,
His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--
His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
His eye commends the leading to his hand;
His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth
His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those:
Hindering their present fall by this dividing;
Hiding base sin in plaits of majesty;
He thence departs a heavy convertite;
He takes it from the rushes where it lies,
He takes for accidental things of trial;
He stories to her ears her husband's fame,
He scowls and hates himself for his offence;
He runs, and chides his vanish'd, loathed delight.
Her twinkling handmaids too, by him defiled,
Her tears should drop on them perpetually.
Her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly,
Her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fix'd
He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
Her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd,
Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,
Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,
Her immortality, and made her thrall
Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
Here with a cockatrice' dead-killing eye
Here she exclaims against repose and rest,
Here pale with fear he doth premeditate
Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.
Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,
Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
He pens her piteous clamours in her head;
He makes excuses for his being there:
He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
He learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way?
He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
He in the worst sense construes their denial:
He in his speed looks for the morning light;
He faintly flies, sneaking with guilty fear;
Having solicited th' eternal power
Having no other pleasure of his gain
Have no perfection of my summer left,
'Have done,' quoth he: 'my uncontrolled tide
Have batter'd down her consecrated wall,
Hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought.
Hateful it is; there is no hate in loving:
Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?
'Hast thou command? by him that gave it thee,
Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells
Haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set
'Had Collatinus kill'd my son or sire,
Grim cave of death! whispering conspirator
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.
Give physic to the sick, ease to the pain'd?
Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust;
From vassal actors can be wiped away;
From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
From thievish ears, because it is his own?
From the besieged Ardea all in post,
From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view
From me by strong assault it is bereft.
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,
From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,
From a pure heart command thy rebel will:
From Venus' doves doth challenge that fair field:
Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
For with the nightly linen that she wears
For what they have not, that which they possess
For unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil;
For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.
For they their guilt with weeping will unfold,
For there it revels; and when that decays,
For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,
For that he colour'd with his high estate,
For stones dissolved to water do convert.
For princes are the glass, the school, the book,
For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?
For now against himself he sounds this doom,
For marks descried in men's nativity
For light and lust are deadly enemies:
For lawful policy remains enacted.
For kings like gods should govern everything.
For it was lent thee all that brood to kill.
For it had been dishonour to disdain him: 895
For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee:
For he the night before, in Tarquin's tent,
'For day,' quoth she, 'nights scapes doth open lay,
Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear!
For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be:
For, after supper, long he questioned
For Collatine's dear love be kept unspotted:
First red as roses that on lawn we lay,
First, like a trumpet, doth his tongue begin
Feeble Desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,
Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,
Fearing some hard news from the warlike band,
Far from the purpose of his coming hither,
'Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not
Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
Even there he starts: quoth he, 'I must deflower:
Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun
Even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth,
Even in the moment that we call them ours.
Ere he can see his own abomination.
Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
End thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended;
Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify,
Drunken Desire must vomit his receipt,
Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,
Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear;
Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,
Dim register and notary of shame!
Devours his will, that lived by foul devouring.
Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining;
Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize;
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
Covers the shame that follows sweet delight.'
Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,
Coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,
Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
Coming from thee, I could not put him back,
Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire,
Can comprehend in still imagination!
By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.
By their high treason is his heart misled;
By reprobate desire thus madly led,
By knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship's oath,
By holy human law, and common troth,
By her untimely tears, her husband's love,
By heaven and earth, and all the power of both,
But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,
But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends;
But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,
But torment that it cannot cure his pain.
But they ne'er meet with Opportunity.
But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;
But that life lived in death, and death in life.
But some untimely thought did instigate
But she with vehement prayers urgeth still
But she, that never coped with stranger eyes,
But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,
But she hath lost a dearer thing than life,
But robb'd and ransack'd by injurious theft:
But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,
But nothing can affection's course control,
But no perfection is so absolute,
But low shrubs wither at the cedar's root.
But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,
But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.
But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,
But ill-annexed Opportunity 925
'But if thou yield, I rest thy secret friend:
But honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,
But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,
But her foresight could not forestall their will.
But happy monarchs still are fear'd for love:
But coward-like with trembling terror die.
But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed.
But beauty, in that white intituled,
But, as they open, they all rate his ill,
But as reproof and reason beat it dead,
But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,
But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;
But I alone alone must sit and pine,
Braving compare, disdainfully did sting
Both which, as servitors to the unjust,
Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,
Blind muffled bawd! dark harbour for defame!
Black stage for tragedies and murders fell!
Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,
Birds never limed no secret bushes fear:
Between whose hills her head entombed is:
Besides, of weariness he did complain him,
Besides, his soul's fair temple is defaced;
Be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans:
Being so bad, such numbers seek for thee?
Beauty itself doth of itself persuade
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire.
Beat at thy rocky and wreck-threatening heart,
Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,
Away he steals with open listening ear,
Authority for sin, warrant for blame,
As who should say 'This glove to wanton tricks
A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth:
As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey,
As palmers' chat makes short their pilgrimage.
As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving
As life for honour in fell battle's rage;
As is the morning's silver-melting dew
As in revenge or quittal of such strife:
As if the heavens should countenance his sin.
As if between them twain there were no strife,
'As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,
As each unwilling portal yields him way,
As corn o'ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear
As I, ere this, was pure to Collatine.
Argued by beauty's red and virtue's white
Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.
Are nature's faults, not their own infamy.'
Are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd.
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,
Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
An expired date, cancell'd ere well begun:
And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success.
And with the wind in greater fury fret:
And with his knee the door he opens wide.
And with good thoughts make dispensation,
And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,
'And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?
And when his gaudy banner is display'd,
And when great treasure is the meed proposed,
And therefore would they still in darkness be,
And useless barns the harvest of his wits; 910
And undeserved reproach to him allotted 875
And to the flame thus speaks advisedly,
And to Collatium bears the lightless fire
And thou, the author of their obloquy,
And this ambitious foul infirmity,
And they would stand auspicious to the hour,
And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
And therein heartens up his servile powers,
And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,
And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,
And talk'd of virtue: O unlook'd-for evil,
And sung by children in succeeding times.
And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.
And stoop to honour, not to foul desire.
And so, by hoping more, they have but less;
And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,
And reverend welcome to her princely guest,
And now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed,
And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.
And my true eyes have never practised how
And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays.
And midst the sentence so her accent breaks,
And makest fair reputation but a bawd.
And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood
And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
And leaves it to be master'd by his young;
And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:
And in thy shady cell, where none may spy him,
And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,
And in his will his wilful eye he tired.
And in this aim there is such thwarting strife,
And in the self-same seat sits Collatine:
And in his inward mind he doth debate
And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight
And he the burden of a guilty mind.
And he hath won what he would lose again:
And grave, like water that doth eat in steel,
And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,
And, if possess'd, as soon decay'd and done
'And how her hand, in my hand being lock'd
And him by oath they truly honoured.
And griping it, the needle his finger pricks;
And girdle with embracing flames the waist
And in her vaulty prison stows the Day.
And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing.
And gazeth on her yet unstained bed.
And fright her with confusion of their cries:
And fright her crying babe with Tarquin's name; 865
And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage,
And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,
And every one to rest themselves betake,
And dotes on what he looks, 'gainst law or duty.
And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot
And death's dim look in life's mortality:
And for himself himself be must forsake:
And decks with praises Collatine's high name,
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,
And by their mortal fault brought in subjection
And bring him where his suit may be obtain'd?
And blows the smoke of it into his face,
And bids it leap from thence, where it may find
And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind.
And being lighted, by the light he spies
And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
And as their captain, so their pride doth grow,
And Tarquin's eye may read the mot afar,
And Lust, the thief, far poorer than before.
A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!
'All which together, like a troubled ocean,
All this beforehand counsel comprehends:
All pure effects, and doth so far proceed,
All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth;
A little harm done to a great good end
Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,
Against the unseen secrecy of night:
Against the golden splendor of the sun!
Against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution.

Advice is sporting while infection breeds:
A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy.
Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.'
A captive victor that hath lost in gain;

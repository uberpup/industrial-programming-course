Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,
But ill-annexed Opportunity 925
This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
But they ne'er meet with Opportunity.
Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.
Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry, 1575
Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
'The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story,
The orator, to deck his oratory,
She dares not thereof make discovery,
Made glorious by his manly chivalry
Those round clear pearls of his, that move thy pity,
How comes it then, vile Opportunity,
'Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity,
Hiding base sin in plaits of majesty;
His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?
Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,
O modest wantons! wanton modesty!
Or kills his life or else his quality.
Then let it not be call'd impiety, 1225
Or sells eternity to get a toy?
Perchance his boast of Lucrece' sovereignty
For marks descried in men's nativity
Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;
Quoth she, 'Reward not hospitality
The little birds that tune their morning's joy
Threatening cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;
And dotes on what he looks, 'gainst law or duty.
With bruised arms and wreaths of victory:
'With this, I did begin to start and cry; 1690
Devise extremes beyond extremity, 1020
With soft-slow tongue, true mark of modesty,
For Helen's rape the city to destroy,
And death's dim look in life's mortality:
A badge of fame to slander's livery; 1105
Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city. 1605
And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy 1480
In great commanders grace and majesty
In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;
'In vain I rail at Opportunity,
Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
Grief best is pleased with grief's society:
And thou, the author of their obloquy,
And this ambitious foul infirmity,
'Why hath thy servant, Opportunity,
Her grief, but not her grief's true quality: 1365
For sparing justice feeds iniquity.
To make the breach and enter this sweet city.
While she, the picture of pure piety,
For perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story
For why her face wore sorrow's livery;
A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy.
For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy; 1160
Stood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy
So with herself is she in mutiny,
Life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny. 1780
Sad souls are slain in merry company;
Brings home his lord and other company; 1635
Her mansion batter'd by the enemy;
To mask their brows and hide their infamy; 845
Are nature's faults, not their own infamy.'
My fame and thy perpetual infamy.'
A dying life to living infamy:
Grossly engirt with daring infamy:
In vain I cavil with mine infamy,
Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy.'
Swearing, unless I took all patiently,
But durst not ask of her audaciously
Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.
Her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly,
Her tears should drop on them perpetually.
Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,
That cannot tread the way out readily;
To talk in deeds, while others saucily 1400
Gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly, 1065
And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,
Wildly determining which way to fly,
That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;
Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly
Wagg'd up and down, and from his lips did fly
Promise more speed, but do it leisurely:
And arm'd his long-hid wits advisedly,
And to the flame thus speaks advisedly,
Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;
Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,
Thin winding breath, which purl'd up to the sky.
Blue circles stream'd; like rainbows in the sky:
Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy 1280
Which, having all, all could not satisfy;
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify,
The spots whereof could weeping purify,
As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey,
Thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy:
Make her moans mad with their sweet melody:
But now he throws that shallow habit by, 1865
was, according to his estate, royally entertained and lodged by
If thou deny, then force must work my way,
Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.
As each unwilling portal yields him way,
Some dark deep desert, seated from the way, 1195
He learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way?
She there remains a hopeless castaway;
While with a joyless smile she turns away
Poor helpless help, the treasure stol'n away,
Then white as lawn, the roses took away.
And unperceived fly with the filth away;
And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away.
Replies her husband: 'do not take away
So must my soul, her bark being peel'd away. 1220
From vassal actors can be wiped away;
So o'er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
The wind wars with his torch to make him stay,
The stain upon his silver down will stay.
That she her plaints a little while doth stay,
When, pattern'd by thy fault, foul sin may say,
My sorrow's interest; let no mourner say
With this, they all at once began to say, 1760
'Then be this all the task it hath to say
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,
Yet neither may possess the claim they lay. 1845
A stranger came, and on that pillow lay
To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!
That done, some worthless slave of thine I'll slay,
Upon the world dim darkness doth display,
'For day,' quoth she, 'nights scapes doth open lay,
First red as roses that on lawn we lay,
Then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.
Poor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day:
Myself was stirring ere the break of day,
Till they might open to adorn the day.
'And for, poor bird, thou sing'st not in the day,
She prays she never may behold the day,
The story of sweet chastity's decay,
To kill thine honour with thy life's decay;
His leaves will wither and his sap decay;
'Make me not object to the tell-tale Day!
And in her vaulty prison stows the Day.
And kiss'd the fatal knife, to end his vow;
The impious breach of holy wedlock vow: 860
The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,
And sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow,
Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow, 1620
To pencill'd pensiveness and colour'd sorrow;
She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,
To ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow
Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow, 1270
Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow:
She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow.
And as their captain, so their pride doth grow,
The light will show, character'd in my brow,
To cloak offences with a cunning brow.
As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow.
By this short schedule Collatine may know
'Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know
The reason of this rash alarm to know,
She modestly prepares to let them know
The homely villain court'sies to her low; 1390
Who, wondering at him, did his words allow:
From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow
Yea the illiterate, that know not how
Burying in Lucrece' wound his folly's show.
Which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show;
Which far exceeds his barren skill to show:
Is it revenge to give thyself a blow
To hide deceit, and give the harmless show
Who, flatter'd by their leader's jocund show,
And my true eyes have never practised how
Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow;
He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
Himself on her self-slaughter'd body threw;
And from the purple fountain Brutus drew 1785
The well-skill'd workman this mild image drew
Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew;
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,
The credulous old Priam after slew;
From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view
The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,
O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!
As is the morning's silver-melting dew
Who fears a sentence or an old man's saw
Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,
Even so his sighs, his sorrows, make a saw,
For me, I force not argument a straw,
Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
To push grief on, and back the same grief draw.
Since that my case is past the help of law.
From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
Who, like a foul ursurper, went about
That jealousy itself could not mistrust
His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust;
Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?
The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust, 1435
False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust
She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,
Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;
Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
When shall he think to find a stranger just,
And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:
Both which, as servitors to the unjust,
He entertain'd a show so seeming just, 1565
Begrimed with sweat, and smeared all with dust;
From the besieged Ardea all in post,
The death of all, and all together lost.
'Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,
Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost
But little stars may hide them when they list.
And girdle with embracing flames the waist
Comparing him to that unhappy guest
And reverend welcome to her princely guest,
Whose deed hath made herself herself detest:
That blow did that it from the deep unrest
And to his protestation urged the rest, 1895
Here she exclaims against repose and rest,
And now this pale swan in her watery nest
'Few words,' quoth she, 'Shall fit the trespass best,
In rage sent out, recall'd in rage, being past:
My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
Thy violent vanities can never last. 945
As lagging fowls before the northern blast:
Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
Back to the strait that forced him on so fast;
Thy private feasting to a public fast,
Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,
His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--
She wakes her heart by beating on her breast,
That patience is quite beaten from her breast.
And merry fools to mock at him resort; 1040
His time of folly and his time of sport;
In time of sorrow, and how swift and short
For stones dissolved to water do convert.
O, if no harder than a stone thou art,
In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art 1445
'And whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part,
But kneel with me and help to bear thy part,
Which once corrupted takes the worser part;
To imitate thee well, against my heart
'Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart
The face of either cipher'd either's heart;
Beat at thy rocky and wreck-threatening heart,
But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,
Drunken Desire must vomit his receipt,
In thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept, 890
And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.
But low shrubs wither at the cedar's root.
The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,
'Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not
Tender my suit: bequeath not to their lot
And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot
Worse than a slavish wipe or birth-hour's blot:
The blemish that will never be forgot;
His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
'I will not poison thee with my attaint,
My sable ground of sin I will not paint, 1125
Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?
And thus begins: 'What uncouth ill event
For he the night before, in Tarquin's tent,
Why art thou thus attired in discontent?
Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
His face, though full of cares, yet show'd content;
'If Collatinus dream of my intent,
The Romans plausibly did give consent 1905
withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent
Foretell new storms to those already spent. 1640
Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
That she with painted images hath spent;
Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,
These means, as frets upon an instrument,
The Argument
Show'd deep regard and smiling government.
By deep surmise of others' detriment; 1630
'Come, Philomel, that sing'st of ravishment,
As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,
Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment.
To Tarquin's everlasting banishment.
These water-galls in her dim element
And as his due writ in my testament.
And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament.
But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent 1450
That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent:
What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
That golden hap which their superiors want.
Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;
The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,
That thou art doting father of his fruit. 1115
The post attends, and she delivers it, 1385
Her letter now is seal'd, and on it writ
The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.'
They that lose half with greater patience bear it
Make something nothing by augmenting it.
'So then he hath it when he cannot use it,
Who in their pride do presently abuse it: 915
'To kill myself,' quoth she, 'alack, what were it,
How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!
My life's foul deed, my life's fair end shall free it.
O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say 'So be it:' 1260
Whose waves to imitate the battle sought
Hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought.
So from himself impiety hath wrought,
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
'Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,
That shuts him from the heaven of his thought,
Which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought,
And from the strand of Dardan, where they fought,
But thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;
And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight
Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,
That it beguiled attention, charm'd the sight: 1455
Proving from world's minority their right:
To wrong the wronger till he render right,
Intending weariness with heavy spright;
This helpless smoke of words doth me no right.
Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright;
To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,
Whether it is that she reflects so bright,
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.
The eye of heaven is out, and misty night
For day hath nought to do what's done by night.'
So surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night:
Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,
She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;
To make him curse this cursed crimeful night:
May set at noon and make perpetual night. 835
Shame folded up in blind concealing night,
Against the unseen secrecy of night:
With pearly sweat, resembling dew of night.
Imagine her as one in dead of night
Now stole upon the time the dead of night,
With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night:
To wake the morn and sentinel the night,
'For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,
Which I to conquer sought with all my might;
No comfortable star did lend his light,
Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
To wink, being blinded with a greater light:
morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight,
To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,
Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light,
He in his speed looks for the morning light;
A creeping creature, with a flaming light,
Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,
Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,
With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight:
More than his eyes were open'd to the light.
This said, he sets his foot upon the light,
The prey wherein by nature they delight;
Covers the shame that follows sweet delight.'
Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight,
My will that marks thee for my earth's delight,
Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight.
Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
He runs, and chides his vanish'd, loathed delight.
That in their smoky ranks his smother'd light
Conceit and grief an eager combat fight; 1350
As 'twere encouraging the Greeks to fight;
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight;
Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;
Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,
'Mis-shapen Time, copesmate of ugly Night,
'O hateful, vaporous, and foggy Night!
At Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful Night; 1075
Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
From me by strong assault it is bereft.
Have no perfection of my summer left,
But robb'd and ransack'd by injurious theft:
Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
Haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set
But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,
And with the wind in greater fury fret:
They, mustering to the quiet cabinet
When Collatine unwisely did not let
Turns not, but swells the higher by this let.
Who with a lingering slay his course doth let,
Thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get;
From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,
On thee and thine this night I will inflict,
If thou my love's desire do contradict.
The things we are for that which we expect;
Such harmless creatures have a true respect
Of that we have: so then we do neglect
When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect
In having much, torments us with defect
The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact,
How can they then assist me in the act?
The petty streams that pay a daily debt
Till every minute pays the hour his debt.
And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
That oft they interchange each other's seat.
But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,
'O Opportunity, thy guilt is great!
The sovereignty of either being so great,
Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,
She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
When he himself himself confounds, betrays
The guilty rebel for remission prays.
And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays.
So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,
Till after many accents and delays, 1770
To slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days?
For there it revels; and when that decays,
Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.
Which not themselves, but he that gives them knows!
To quench the coal which in his liver glows.
Who being stopp'd, the bounding banks o'erflows; 1170
Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,
Corrupted blood some watery token shows;
No object but her passion's strength renews;
Holds disputation with each thing she views,
Pleads, in a wilderness where are no laws,
Like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws,
the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus
in several disports. Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus
accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius;
Lucius Tarquinius, for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus,
A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
My restless discord loves no stops nor rests; 1175
Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests? 900
Or kings be breakers of their own behests?
Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts?
Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,
Grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts,
And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts. 1290
To blot old books and alter their contents,
'To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,
That eye which looks on her confounds his wits;
And useless barns the harvest of his wits; 910
But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,
Within his thought her heavenly image sits,
Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits;
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.
Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.
And dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights, 1430
Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
With sad set eyes, and wretched arms across,
Lo, here, the hopeless merchant of this loss,
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
For what they have not, that which they possess
For more it is than I can well express:
Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,
And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.'
Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,
She would request to know your heaviness.' 1335
Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness.
And let mild women to him lose their mildness, 1030
And so, by hoping more, they have but less;
The repetition cannot make it less;
Or, gaining more, the profit of excess
And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success.
Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,
And shivered all the beauty of my glass,
What virtue breeds iniquity devours:
We have no good that we can say is ours,
The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
Even in the moment that we call them ours.
To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours, 995
Stuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours;
We are their offspring, and they none of ours.
If children predecease progenitors,
Unprofitable sounds, weak arbitrators!
To trembling clients be you mediators:
And smear with dust their glittering golden towers;
And therein heartens up his servile powers,
Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers;
Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters; 1070
For with the nightly linen that she wears
Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
Wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears,
The face, that map which deep impression bears
And waste huge stones with little water drops. 1010
To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,
Justice is feasting while the widow weeps;
And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.
'The patient dies while the physician sleeps; 955
Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps, 1625
possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons
In such relenting dew of lamentations; 1880
That they will suffer these abominations,
To rouse our Roman gods with invocations,
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
Be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans:
Mingling my talk with tears, my grief with groans,
Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,
To chase injustice with revengeful arms:
Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies' harms.' 1745
Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;
To make him moan; but pity not his moans:
If ever man were moved with woman moans,
Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.
Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,
Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms. 1570
O impious act, including all foul harms!
Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.
'O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!
cruelly murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs,
Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
government changed from kings to consuls.
Busy yourselves in skill-contending schools;
'Out, idle words, servants to shallow fools!
Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells
With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells.
Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails, 1615
Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.
Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,
Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,
She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
Poor women's faces are their own fault's books.
Writ in the glassy margents of such books:
To cipher what is writ in learned books,
Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.
The curtains being close, about he walks,
Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,
Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:
As who should say 'This glove to wanton tricks
And griping it, the needle his finger pricks;
And midst the sentence so her accent breaks,
That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.
The one doth call her his, the other his,
The father says 'She's mine.' 'O, mine she is,'
Between whose hills her head entombed is:
To pluck the quills from ancient ravens' wings, 1000
To dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs,
As silly-jeering idiots are with kings,
'Time's glory is to calm contending kings, 990
For sportive words and uttering foolish things:
To feed oblivion with decay of things,
To stamp the seal of time in aged things,
And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes 1520
And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,
To cheque the tears in Collatinus' eyes.
'Look, look, how listening Priam wets his eyes,
That my poor beauty had purloin'd his eyes;
That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!
On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,
Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes:
But she, that never coped with stranger eyes,
And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,
She, much amazed, breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes,
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes:
In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.
To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.
To whom she sobbing speaks: 'O eye of eyes,
To be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes.
Staring on Priam's wounds with her old eyes,
And as one shifts, another straight ensues: 1155
'Why hunt I then for colour or excuses?
Nor fold my fault in cleanly-coin'd excuses;
To hide the truth of this false night's abuses:
Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;
Their silent war of lilies and of roses,
In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;
Amazedly in her sad face he stares:
To ask the spotted princess how she fares.
He hath no power to ask her how she fares: 1645
Her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.
To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares,
And shapes her sorrow to the beldam's woes,
So mild, that Patience seem'd to scorn his woes.
To endless date of never-ending woes?
And ever since, as pitying Lucrece' woes,
Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes; 1545
Of that black blood a watery rigol goes,
Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
Neglected all, with swift intent he goes
Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes, 1555
'Let him have time to see his friends his foes,
And bitter words to ban her cruel foes:
Time's office is to fine the hate of foes;
Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
As smoke from AEtna, that in air consumes,
Or that which from discharged cannon fumes.
And sung by children in succeeding times.
Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.
Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties,
Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries;
Who nothing wants to answer her but cries, 1510
'Daughter, dear daughter,' old Lucretius cries,
And fright her with confusion of their cries:
No noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries;
The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries;
Revealing day through every cranny spies,
And being lighted, by the light he spies
For light and lust are deadly enemies:
Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.
O, how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
Where their dear governess and lady lies,
Which bleeding under Pyrrhus' proud foot lies. 1500
He takes it from the rushes where it lies,
Where her beloved Collatinus lies.
So under his insulting falchion lies
Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,
Like to a new-kill'd bird she trembling lies;
For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.
Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?'
Where, like a virtuous monument, she lies,
If in the child the father's image lies,
Which, like a falcon towering in the skies,
Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies;
And when the judge is robb'd the prisoner dies.
'Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,
Whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies:
Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies
Wrath, envy, treason, rape, and murder's rages, 960
Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages.
Thus cavils she with every thing she sees:
Who wayward once, his mood with nought agrees:
'Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances, 1025
Let there bechance him pitiful mischances,
My tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,
All jointly listening, but with several graces,
Pale cowards, marching on with trembling paces;
And little stars shot from their fixed places,
You might behold, triumphing in their faces; 1440
When their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces.
About him were a press of gaping faces,
It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
With sad attention long to hear her words.
Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
As, but for loss of Nestor's golden words,
And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words.
While Collatine and his consorted lords 1660
Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,
Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds,
And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,
And one man's lust these many lives confounds: 1540
For men have marble, women waxen, minds,
Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.'
To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:
The weak oppress'd, the impression of strange kinds
that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds
Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends: 1015
But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends;
Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,
All this beforehand counsel comprehends:
I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands,
The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.'
To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds! 1600
Advice is sporting while infection breeds:
For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds:
For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds? 1875
The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds;
Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
Thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds:
Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;
Without the bed her other fair hand was,
That I no more can see what once I was! 1815
Not that devour'd, but that which doth devour,
And they would stand auspicious to the hour,
Thy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur
When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.
The eyes of men without an orator;
Grim cave of death! whispering conspirator
Now is he come unto the chamber-door,
Much like a press of people at a door,
maids: the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or
'Show me the strumpet that began this stir,
Let him have time of Time's help to despair,
Make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair: 1180
'Let him have time to tear his curled hair,
'With rotten damps ravish the morning air;
That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,
The life of purity, the supreme fair,
But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,
Having solicited th' eternal power
Even there he starts: quoth he, 'I must deflower:
No man inveigh against the wither'd flower, 1305
To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter
With words, till action might become them better. 1375
To live or die which of the twain were better, 1205
So Priam's trust false Sinon's tears doth flatter,
To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,
'To show the beldam daughters of her daughter,
Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son, in their discourses after
That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.'
Whose love of either to myself was nearer,
'My body or my soul, which was the dearer,
Little suspecteth the false worshipper;
At last she smilingly with this gives o'er;
At last it rains, and busy winds give o'er:
There might you see the labouring pioner
Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier:
his wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her
This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.
To view thy present trespass in another.
Their own transgressions partially they smother:
Far from the purpose of his coming hither,
hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father,
No cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
With close-tongued treason and the ravisher!
Or why is Collatine the publisher
of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her
Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her
She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her: 1370
From that suspicion which the world might bear her.
Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
'O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,
So guiltless she securely gives good cheer
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer,
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,
How he in peace is wounded, not in war.
To set forth that which is so singular?
And Tarquin's eye may read the mot afar,
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
Another smother'd seems to pelt and swear;
That with my nails her beauty I may tear.
She, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear;
Many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear,
So I at each sad strain will strain a tear,
His nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear;
That for Achilles' image stood his spear, 1475
Men's faults do seldom to themselves appear;
That through their light joy seemed to appear, 1485
Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear;
And from the towers of Troy there would appear
'Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear: 1380
Until her husband's welfare she did hear;
Away he steals with open listening ear,
Like bright things stain'd, a kind of heavy fear.
He faintly flies, sneaking with guilty fear;
They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.
Birds never limed no secret bushes fear:
'This deed will make thee only loved for fear;
As corn o'ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear
Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear!
And far the weaker with so strong a fear:
For then eye interprets to the ear
A letter to my lord, my love, my dear; 1345
And in their rage such signs of rage they bear, 1470
With foul offenders thou perforce must bear,
Bid thou be ready, by and by, to bear
And with deep groans the diapason bear;
This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear: 1525
When every part a part of woe doth bear.
Till sable Night, mother of Dread and Fear,
O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
Lays open all the little worms that creep;
Through crystal walls each little mote will peep:
Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep:
The grief away that stops his answer so: 1715
Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,
The niggard prodigal that praised her so,--
I will not wrong thy true affection so,
And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.
Poor Lucrece' cheeks unto her maid seem so
Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.'
'And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,
Upon his head that hath transgressed so;
Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so, 1275
He with the Romans was esteemed so
Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so
Receives the scroll without or yea or no,
To those two armies that would let him go,
From thievish ears, because it is his own?
I'll beg her love; but she is own:
Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
'Shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known:
Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?
Against the golden splendor of the sun!
Look, as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,
Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun
An expired date, cancell'd ere well begun:
Shows me a bare-boned death by time out-worn:
O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,
For in my death I murder shameful scorn: 1240
My shame so dead, mine honour is new-born.
In thy sweet semblance my old age new born; 1810
Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
'And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?
Whoever plots the sin, thou 'point'st the season; 930
'Tis thou that executest the traitor's treason:
'Tis thou that spurn'st at right, at law, at reason;
Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon
To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.
Against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution.
My will is back'd with resolution:
The blackest sin is clear'd with absolution;
But with my body my poor soul's pollution?
To soften it with their continual motion;
At this request, with noble disposition
As bound in knighthood to her imposition,
She says, her subjects with foul insurrection
And by their mortal fault brought in subjection
If that be made a theme for disputation,
Thus, graceless, holds he disputation
'Let my good name, that senseless reputation,
And with good thoughts make dispensation,
Guilty of perjury and subornation, 970
Guilty of incest, that abomination;
Ere he can see his own abomination.
An accessary by thine inclination
Can comprehend in still imagination!
While Lust is in his pride, no exclamation
That mother tries a merciless conclusion
Than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion. 1210
Besides, the life and feeling of her passion
That now he vows a league, and now invasion.
So cross him with their opposite persuasion,
When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
As if the heavens should countenance his sin.
Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin
Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
Who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,
Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.
That for his prey to pray he doth begin,
First, like a trumpet, doth his tongue begin
Her blue blood changed to black in every vein, 1505
To wish that I their father had not bin.
But, wretched as he is, he strives in vain;
'In vain,' quoth she, 'I live, and seek in vain 1095
Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,
The silver-shining queen he would distain;
And why not I from this compelled stain?'
The weary time she cannot entertain,
This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,
So should I have co-partners in my pain; 840
But torment that it cannot cure his pain.
Leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain.
This momentary joy breeds months of pain;
'So thy surviving husband shall remain
In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain 1300
The scar that will, despite of cure, remain;
Of what she was no semblance did remain:
I fear'd by Tarquin's falchion to be slain,
Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,
Yet sometime 'Tarquin' was pronounced plain,
Having no other pleasure of his gain
A captive victor that hath lost in gain;
The poison'd fountain clears itself again;
And he hath won what he would lose again:
What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.
Through Night's black bosom should not peep again:
But long she thinks till he return again,
Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,
That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain.
This hot desire converts to cold disdain:
For 'tis a meritorious fair design
Time's ruin, beauty's wreck, and grim care's reign:
'Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen:
What should I say? One of my husband's men
Of either's colour was the other queen,
This heraldry in Lucrece' face was seen,
To Simois' reedy banks the red blood ran,
For now 'tis stale to sigh, to weep, and groan:
So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan, 1415
To break upon the galled shore, and than
With swelling ridges; and their ranks began 1490
'All which together, like a troubled ocean,
Throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm;
Th' one sweetly flatters, th' other feareth harm;
But honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,
Th' adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom.
Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
For now against himself he sounds this doom,
To be thy partner in this shameful doom.'
From the creation to the general doom. 975
When they had sworn to this advised doom, 1900
And in thy shady cell, where none may spy him,
But her foresight could not forestall their will.
The doors, the wind, the glove, that did delay him,
Through which I may convey this troubled soul.
But nothing can affection's course control,
Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.
Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool, 1870
'Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,
The locks between her chamber and his will,
First hovering o'er the paper with her quill:
For burden-wise I'll hum on Tarquin still,
But she with vehement prayers urgeth still
An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,
Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still,
Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;
And therefore are they form'd as marble will;
And still on him she gazed; and gazing still,
Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.
Yet for thy honour did I entertain him;
Besides, of weariness he did complain him,
For it had been dishonour to disdain him: 895
Swearing I slew him, seeing thee embrace him.
And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,
And then in key-cold Lucrece' bleeding stream 1825
By this, starts Collatine as from a dream,
'I have debated, even in my soul,
The deep vexation of his inward soul 1830
Who, mad that sorrow should his use control,
'Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;
From a pure heart command thy rebel will:
What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;
'Tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,
The silly lambs: pure thoughts are dead and still,
In his clear bed might have reposed still:
Which in her prescience she controlled still,
Teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill!
Under what colour he commits this ill.
But, as they open, they all rate his ill,
Then call them not the authors of their ill, 1295
Then had they seen the period of their ill;
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill; 1050
So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill:
And chid the painter for his wondrous skill,
In him the painter labour'd with his skill
Is form'd in them by force, by fraud, or skill:
While thou on Tereus descant'st better skill. 1185
With too much labour drowns for want of skill. 1150
Himself himself seek every hour to kill!
The loathsome act of lust, and so did kill
But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;
Which in a moment doth confound and kill
For it was lent thee all that brood to kill.
While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.
This is too curious-good, this blunt and ill:
When more is felt than one hath power to tell. 1340
So Lucrece, set a-work, sad tales doth tell
Then little strength rings out the doleful knell:
'O comfort-killing Night, image of hell!
For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,
'Such devils steal effects from lightless hell;
And that deep torture may be call'd a hell
Black stage for tragedies and murders fell!
My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell;
Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!--
Have batter'd down her consecrated wall,
Her immortality, and made her thrall
For one's offence why should so many fall,
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
And therein so ensconced his secret evil,
And talk'd of virtue: O unlook'd-for evil,
For unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil;
Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.
This earthly saint, adored by this devil,
And the dire thought of his committed evil
No more than wax shall be accounted evil
But, like a constant and confirmed devil,
When virtue is profaned in such a devil!
Wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil.
Thy princely office how canst thou fulfil,
And swear I found you where you did fulfil
And grave, like water that doth eat in steel,
To spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel,
And turn the giddy round of Fortune's wheel;
Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel.'
To living death and pain perpetual:
To plague a private sin in general? 1535
people were so moved, that with one consent and a general
He takes for accidental things of trial;
He in the worst sense construes their denial:
Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,
I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;
Look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,
'It cannot be' she in that sense forsook,
She would have said 'can lurk in such a look;'
Where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look.
'To thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
And from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took:
For princes are the glass, the school, the book,
And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,
Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk
Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?
'What win I, if I gain the thing I seek?
Feeble Desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,
Let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick 830
Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!
'Yet am I guilty of thy honour's wrack;
Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black:
Coming from thee, I could not put him back,
O, this dread night, wouldst thou one hour come back,
But now the mindful messenger, come back,
Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak
'Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,
'My girl,' quoth she, 'on what occasion break
Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
But more than 'he' her poor tongue could not speak;
My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
By this, mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak
This bastard graff shall never come to growth:
Thou smother'st honesty, thou murder'st troth;
By holy human law, and common troth,
The stained taste of violated troth; 1110
By heaven and earth, and all the power of both,
This said, from her be-tumbled couch she starteth,
But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth 1090
A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth:
His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth
While in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth:
His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,
Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,
Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth
Even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth,
And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:
'Thou makest the vestal violate her oath;
Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,
My woe too sensible thy passion maketh
Another power; no flood by raining slaketh.
Which, thronging through her lips, so vanisheth
Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth, 1725
'Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth:
All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth;
Affection is my captain, and he leadeth;
By knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship's oath,
To flatter thee with an infringed oath;
My stained blood to Tarquin I'll bequeath,
Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
Till manly shame bids him possess his breath
Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
To make more vent for passage of her breath;
Have heard the cause of my untimely death;
And live to be revenged on her death.
To find some desperate instrument of death:
Showing life's triumph in the map of death,
So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.
With inward vice: as Priam him did cherish,
The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,
The more she thought he spied in her some blemish. 1410
This said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,
The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch:
Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch:
But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,
And leaves it to be master'd by his young;
In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,
And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,
And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong;
By that her death, to do her husband wrong: 1315
Assail'd by night with circumstances strong
Their father was too weak, and they too strong,
Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng
supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife: among
And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long;
And my laments would be drawn out too long,
To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long.
Such danger to resistance did belong,
Hateful it is; there is no hate in loving:
As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving
Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,
'No, no,' quoth she, 'no dame, hereafter living, 1765
Braving compare, disdainfully did sting
Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,
Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
The worst is but denial and reproving:
My will is strong, past reason's weak removing.
By my excuse shall claim excuse's giving.'
Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting:
Devours his will, that lived by foul devouring.
I think the honey guarded with a sting;
In bloody death and ravishment delighting,
And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting,
The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing;
And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing.
Nor children's tears nor mothers' groans respecting,
His taste delicious, in digestion souring,
When thus thy vices bud before thy spring!
'Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring; 920
Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece' beauty, yet smothering
'I see what crosses my attempt will bring;
And seems to point her out where she sits weeping;
Why pry'st thou through my window? leave thy peeping: 1140
Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining:
Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping:
Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,
If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining,
Short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining:
The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;
raining?
Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining.
And both she thinks too long with her remaining:
No penetrable entrance to her plaining:
And time doth weary time with her complaining.
To the poor counterfeit of her complaining: 1320
Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining;
Their gentle sex to weep are often willing;
No cause, but company, of her drops spilling:
Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling: 1285
'Thou art,' quoth she, 'a sea, a sovereign king;
Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking;
Suggested this proud issue of a king;
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,
What terror or 'tis! but she, in worser taking,
What darest thou not when once thou art a king?
'The baser is he, coming from a king,
Thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;
For kings like gods should govern everything.
Pain pays the income of each precious thing;
O, be remember'd, no outrageous thing
But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,
The mightier man, the mightier is the thing 1055
Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,
In me moe woes than words are now depending;
Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending;
Where no excuse can give the fault amending: 1665
Hindering their present fall by this dividing;
In his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding,
Which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding,
the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of
intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of
Thy honey turns to gall, thy joy to grief! 940
So, I commend me from our house in grief: 1360
My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.'
Thou ravisher, thou traitor, thou false thief,
Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize;
When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.
Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,
As the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze, 1200
But eagles gazed upon with every eye.
And, blushing on her, with a steadfast eye
Save something too much wonder of his eye,
The scornful mark of every open eye;
Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye;
Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
Here with a cockatrice' dead-killing eye
Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye;
My heart shall never countermand mine eye:
And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,
And round about her tear-stained eye
Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.
Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe
Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe.'
When they in thee the like offences prove:
If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
By her untimely tears, her husband's love,
But happy monarchs still are fear'd for love:
She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
'Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive,
If they surcease to be that should survive.
Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,
'O, that is gone for which I sought to live,
And time to see one that by alms doth live
And leave the faltering feeble souls alive?
The old bees die, the young possess their hive: 1820
Disdain to him disdained scraps to give.
To clear this spot by death, at least I give
Let him have time against himself to rave,
O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
Thou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave:
Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!
'So shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave;
Let him have time to live a loathed slave, 1035
As slanderous death's-man to so base a slave?
Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.
For who so base would such an office have
True valour still a true respect should have;
That blushing red no guilty instance gave,
Of present death, and shame that might ensue
The sight which makes supposed terror true.
Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,
Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,--
Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;
I'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue;
To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.
To give her so much grief and not a tongue.
But no perfection is so absolute,
That some impurity doth not pollute. 905
He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.'
Thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste:
To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls' haste
Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
Is not inured; return again in haste;
'At Ardea to my lord with more than haste.'
Thou see'st our mistress' ornaments are chaste.'
Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste.
That my posterity, shamed with the note
To cipher me how fondly I did dote;
He thence departs a heavy convertite;
This bateless edge on his keen appetite;
Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.
Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,
That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,
Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
When beauty boasted blushes, in despite
In vain I spurn at my confirm'd despite:
On the green coverlet; whose perfect white
Argued by beauty's red and virtue's white
In speech, it seem'd, his beard, all silver white,
Virtue would stain that o'er with silver white.
When shame assail'd, the red should fence the white.
To praise the clear unmatched red and white
Unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;
Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:
'So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state'--
For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.
His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,
acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state
For that he colour'd with his high estate,
Here pale with fear he doth premeditate
To shame his hope with deeds degenerate:
Reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate,
Melt at my tears, and be compassionate!
That nothing in him seem'd inordinate,
In the possession of his beauteous mate;
That makes him honour'd, or begets him hate;
Yield to my love; if not, enforced hate,
Basely with gold, but stol'n from forth thy gate.
Soft pity enters at an iron gate.
But some untimely thought did instigate
For me, I am the mistress of my fate, 1120
And in his inward mind he doth debate
'O, teach me how to make mine own excuse!
Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
Betray'd the hours thou gavest me to repose,
Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
Though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse,
He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause
The painter was no god to lend her those;
His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those:
May my pure mind with the foul act dispense, 1755
Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;
And with my trespass never will dispense,
Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?
Wherein deep policy did him disguise;
O, how her fear did make her colour rise!
Now serves the season that they may surprise
The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,
What following sorrow may on this arise:
'Thou wronged lord of Rome,' quoth be, 'arise:
Then looking scornfully, he doth despise
Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;
Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case:
Then my digression is so vile, so base,
To accessary yieldings, but still pure
Doth in her poison'd closet yet endure.' 1710
He doth again repeat, and that they swore.
But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,
By heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's store,
Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
But through his teeth, as if the name he tore.
'Fool, fool!' quoth she, 'his wounds will not be sore.'
Held back his sorrow's tide, to make it more; 1840
That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more.
Which with a yielding latch, and with no more,
To see the salve doth make the wound ache more;
'Tis double death to drown in ken of shore; 1165
Throng her inventions, which shall go before.
And Lust, the thief, far poorer than before.
And that deep vow, which Brutus made before,
'Now, by the Capitol that we adore,
Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
Till like a jade Self-will himself doth tire.
Let him return, and flattering thoughts retire:
At length address'd to answer his desire,
That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
'Had Collatinus kill'd my son or sire,
So Lucrece must I force to my desire.'
Or were he not my dear friend, this desire
But if the like the snow-white swan desire,
And stoop to honour, not to foul desire.
Had doting Priam cheque'd his son's desire,
Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire,
His true respect will prison false desire,
Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,
Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire.
Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire
'The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire, 1060
Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire, 1655
And to Collatium bears the lightless fire
'As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,
Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.'
'Think but how vile a spectacle it were,
A thousand lamentable objects there, 1425
For much imaginary work was there;
Night-wandering weasels shriek to see him there;
She like a wearied lamb lies panting there;
He makes excuses for his being there:
No rightful plea might plead for justice there: 1700
Yet save that labour, for I have them here.
Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here;
Thou nursest all and murder'st all that are: 980
Those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are
And to herself all sorrow doth compare;
Base watch of woes, sin's pack-horse, virtue's snare;
Swift subtle post, carrier of grisly care,
So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,
Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe:
'Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?
Seeing such emulation in their woe,
Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,
With head declined, and voice damm'd up with woe,
Nor why her fair cheeks over-wash'd with woe.
Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
A brow unbent, that seem'd to welcome woe; 1560
Become the public plague of many moe? 1530
Be suddenly revenged on my foe,
Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,
To sound a parley to his heartless foe;
To slay herself, that should have slain her foe.
Her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe;
And wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe,
Rather than triumph in so false a foe.
To strike a poor unseasonable doe.
And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,
Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,
Will slay the other and be nurse to none.
Let sin, alone committed, light alone
And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.
'Why should the private pleasure of some one
another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one
And, if possess'd, as soon decay'd and done
With your uncleanness that which is divine;
That eye which him beholds, as more divine,
When the one pure, the other made divine? 1215
'Yet die I will not till my Collatine
And only must be wail'd by Collatine.' 1850
And in the self-same seat sits Collatine:
As I, ere this, was pure to Collatine.
Speaking to those that came with Collatine, 1740
When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?
How Tarquin wronged me, I Collatine. 870
Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:
Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine,
Ay me! the bark peel'd from the lofty pine,
But I alone alone must sit and pine,
That thou shalt see thy state and pity mine.'
He weeps for her, for she was only mine,
For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.
To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,
That is as clear from this attaint of mine
That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine, 1230
With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;
Will tie the hearers to attend each line,
Unto a view so false will not incline;
Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,
To darken her whose light excelleth thine:
Some present speed to come and visit me.
'Shall plight your honourable faiths to me,
By foul enforcement might be done to me,
My Collatine would else have come to me
That guides this hand to give this wound to me.'
Many she sees where cares have carved some,
To all sins past, and all that are to come,
To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,
And never be forgot in mighty Rome 1695
To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,
So fares it with this faultful lord of Rome,
'If, Collatine, thine honour lay in me, 885
How Tarquin must be used, read it in me:
To all the host of heaven I complain me,
'How may this forced stain be wiped from me?
Have time to wail th' abusing of his time. 1045
Make war against proportion'd course of time; 825
'So, so,' quoth he, 'these lets attend the time,
To add a more rejoicing to the prime,
Be guilty of my death, since of my crime.
Since thou art guilty of my cureless crime,
And ever let his unrecalling crime
O, hear me then, injurious, shifting Time!
'Where now I have no one to blush with me,
To those that live, and think no shame of me. 1255
Thou look'st not like deceit; do not deceive me.
Thyself art mighty; for thine own sake leave me:
'My husband is thy friend; for his sake spare me:
Myself a weakling; do not then ensnare me:
For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:
From what is past: the help that thou shalt lend me
Thine, mine, his own: suppose thou dost defend me 1735
Cancell'd my fortunes, and enchained me 985
Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me.
Thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same,
Thou wrong'st his honour, wound'st his princely name.
To privilege dishonour in thy name?
And fright her crying babe with Tarquin's name; 865
And decks with praises Collatine's high name,
Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name,
Authority for sin, warrant for blame,
Imagine every eye beholds their blame; 1395
With men's abuses: those proud lords, to blame, 1310
Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame?
Vast sin-concealing chaos! nurse of blame!
Will couple my reproach to Tarquin's shame;
Honour thyself to rid me of this shame:
When virtue bragg'd, beauty would blush for shame;
Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.
'Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,
Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?
Must he in thee read lectures of such shame?
This dying virtue, this surviving shame,
And entertain my love; else lasting shame 1680
Dim register and notary of shame!
For Lucrece thought he blush'd to her see shame:
He stories to her ears her husband's fame,
Which of them both should underprop her fame:
That kings might be espoused to more fame,
But if I live, thou livest in my defame:
Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,
Blind muffled bawd! dark harbour for defame!
But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.
And softly cried 'Awake, thou Roman dame,
Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame,
Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame, 1085
With shining falchion in my chamber came
If in this blemish'd fort I make some hole
'It cannot be,' quoth she,'that so much guile'-- 1585
But Tarquin's shape came in her mind the while,
Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,
That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.
Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.'
That even for anger makes the lily pale,
Left there round turrets destitute and pale.
As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,
Under that colour am I come to scale
Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,
'O Night, thou furnace of foul-reeking smoke, 850
Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.
My resolution, husband, do thou take;
The shame that from them no device can take,
And every one to rest themselves betake,
'Then, for thy husband and thy children's sake,
And for himself himself be must forsake:
'O, what excuse can my invention make,
Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
'This brief abridgement of my will I make:
Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,
But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.
Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die;
But coward-like with trembling terror die.
The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die.
And therefore now I need not fear to die.
'Then, childish fear, avaunt! debating, die!
Who, if it wink, shall thereon fall and die. 1190
his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the
into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the
bitter invective against the tyranny of the king: wherewith the
they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the
She utters this, 'He, he, fair lords, 'tis he,
'But ere I name him, you fair lords,' quoth she,
The protestation stops. 'O, speak, ' quoth she,
'For some hard-favour'd groom of thine,' quoth he,
and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea. During which siege
And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage,
Even so this pattern of the worn-out age
My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,
Sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage;
If in thy hope thou darest do such outrage,
As life for honour in fell battle's rage;
Will he not wake, and in a desperate rage
One poor retiring minute in an age
'Why work'st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage,
As palmers' chat makes short their pilgrimage.
This siege that hath engirt his marriage,
Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.
With honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;
That one for all, or all for one we gage;
'How will thy shame be seeded in thine age,
Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
'Woe, woe,' quoth Collatine, 'she was my wife,
Answer'd their cries, 'my daughter' and 'my wife.'
Might have excuse to work upon his wife,
whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife
Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.
But when I fear'd I was a loyal wife:
We will revenge the death of this true wife.'
Shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife:
The red blood reek'd, to show the painter's strife;
This forced league doth force a further strife;
As if between them twain there were no strife,
Then son and father weep with equal strife
As in revenge or quittal of such strife:
And in this aim there is such thwarting strife,
Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,
'My honour I'll bequeath unto the knife 1235
Yet for the self-same purpose seek a knife:
Or lain in ambush to betray my life,
'O,' quoth Lucretius,' I did give that life
Some happy mean to end a hapless life.
In scorn of nature, art gave lifeless life:
But that life lived in death, and death in life.
But she hath lost a dearer thing than life,
The aim of all is but to nurse the life
The dispersed air, who, holding Lucrece' life,
'Tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life;
If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see--
But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see, 1135
'They think not but that every eye can see
Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again and see
From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free. 1675
'Poor hand, why quiver'st thou at this decree?
For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee:
'Lucrece,' quoth he,'this night I must enjoy thee:
When Tarquin did, but he was stay'd by thee.
'Hast thou command? by him that gave it thee,
The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee;
Being so bad, such numbers seek for thee?
Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee:
I'll murder straight, and then I'll slaughter thee 1685
Thy father die, and not thy father thee!
Instead of love's coy touch, shall rudely tear thee;
No more,' quoth he; 'by heaven, I will not hear thee:
That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee
Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee;
What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?
For if I die, my honour lives in thee;
'In Tarquin's likeness I did entertain thee:
'When Truth and Virtue have to do with thee,
Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,
My sighs, like whirlwinds, labour hence to heave thee:
They buy thy help; but Sin ne'er gives a fee,
My honour lost, and I, a drone-like bee,
And with his knee the door he opens wide.
And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide
'Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide!
As through an arch the violent roaring tide
'Have done,' quoth he: 'my uncontrolled tide
Circles her body in on every side, 1790
Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,
Then Collatine again, by Lucrece' side,
Brutus, who pluck'd the knife from Lucrece' side,
Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;
Thou loathed in their shame, they in thy pride:
Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride 1720
Began to clothe his wit in state and pride, 1860
The lesser thing should not the greater hide;
'Thus I forestall thee, if thou mean to chide:
Small lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide,
Where thou with patience must my will abide;
And blood untainted still doth red abide, 1800
Beauty itself doth of itself persuade
That all the faults which in thy reign are made 855
What needeth then apologies be made,
This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,
May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade!
Coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,
He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence;
Till after a deep groan--'Tarquin from hence?'
Which being done with speedy diligence,
'The more to blame my sluggard negligence: 1330
He scowls and hates himself for his offence;
And so to publish Tarquin's foul offence:
'What is the quality of mine offence,
Till life to death acquit my forced offence.
My low-declined honour to advance?
Being constrain'd with dreadful circumstance?
Both stood, like old acquaintance in a trance,
Met far from home, wondering each other's chance.
May any terms acquit me from this chance?
Which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice; 1460
As if some mermaid did their ears entice,
Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
More feeling-painful: let it then suffice 1730
The Rape of Lucrece
At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
Before the which is drawn the power of Greece. 1420
And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,
Immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace!
'O unseen shame! invisible disgrace!
Which to her oratory adds more grace.
The flesh being proud, Desire doth fight with Grace,
With heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace,
And counterfeits to die with her a space;
Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;
She puts the period often from his place;
The murderous knife, and, as it left the place,
Through little vents and crannies of the place
Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:
That it will live engraven in my face.
Thus he replies: 'The colour in thy face,
Let not the jealous Day behold that face
Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face, 880
And blows the smoke of it into his face,
He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,
In the remorseless wrinkles of his face;
About the mourning and congealed face 1795
By whose example thou revenged mayest be. 1245
So am I now: O no, that cannot be; 1100
And therefore would they still in darkness be,
Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.'
after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be
So that in venturing ill we leave to be
The lechers in their deed: this act will be
And therefore still in night would cloister'd be.
For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be:
And all my fame that lives disbursed be
'But tell me, girl, when went'--and there she stay'd
Longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd.
The coward fights and will not be dismay'd.
And when his gaudy banner is display'd,
Her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd,
Her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fix'd
As heaven, it seem'd, to kiss the turrets bow'd.
Thou blow'st the fire when temperance is thaw'd; 935
Thou foul abettor! thou notorious bawd!
And makest fair reputation but a bawd.
Which the conceited painter drew so proud,
Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
'Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud?
Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud:
Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,
The moon being clouded presently is miss'd,
May feel her heart-poor citizen!--distress'd,
Whose inward ill no outward harm express'd:
And then against my heart he sets his sword,
I should not live to speak another word;
At last she thus begins: 'Thou worthy lord 1355
Health to thy person! next vouchsafe t' afford--
So should my shame still rest upon record,
Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
Which drives the creeping thief to some regard:
The threshold grates the door to have him heard;
Who, like a late-sack'd island, vastly stood
That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,
Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood: 1325
And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood
Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.
Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.
In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood
Is to let forth my foul-defiled blood. 1080
If all these pretty ills shall change thy good,
Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
The remedy indeed to do me good
If tears could help, mine own would do me good.
He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
Mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound;
And drop sweet balm in Priam's painted wound,
'Poor instrument,' quoth she,'without a sound, 1515
She throws her eyes about the painting round, 1550
My soul and body to the skies and ground; 1250
My shame be his that did my fame confound;
At last she sees a wretched image bound,
Those that much covet are with gain so fond,
They scatter and unloose it from their bond,
And he the burden of a guilty mind.
Immaculate and spotless is my mind;
Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind:
To jump up higher seem'd, to mock the mind. 1465
But such a face should bear a wicked mind.
Some purer chest to close so pure a mind.
And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind.
Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,
She bears the load of lust he left behind,
Griped in an armed hand; himself, behind,
The scalps of many, almost hid behind,
And bids it leap from thence, where it may find
Or at the least this refuge let me find; 1705
And turn'd it thus,' It cannot be, I find, 1590
And by this chaste blood so unjustly stain'd,
And some look'd black, and that false Tarquin stain'd.
By all our country rights in Rome maintain'd,
And bring him where his suit may be obtain'd?
Give physic to the sick, ease to the pain'd?
Some of her blood still pure and red remain'd,
And by chaste Lucrece' soul that late complain'd 1890
Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain'd?
The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.
When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end? 950
'But if thou yield, I rest thy secret friend:
'When wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend,
But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,
A little harm done to a great good end
Smoking with pride, march'd on to make his stand
A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,
There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,
Hath thee befall'n, that thou dost trembling stand? 1650
On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;
At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,
His eye commends the leading to his hand;
Making such sober action with his hand,
One justly weeps; the other takes in hand
Quoth he, 'She took me kindly by the hand,
revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and
camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and
Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they posted to Rome; and
Fearing some hard news from the warlike band,
Their face their manners most expressly told:
To have their unseen sin remain untold;
To see sad sights moves more than hear them told;
'O, peace!' quoth Lucrece: 'if it should be told,
Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!
These contraries such unity do hold,
The same disgrace which they themselves behold;
Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,
The heavy motion that it doth behold,
Of physiognomy might one behold!
As shaming any eye should thee behold,
'Poor broken glass, I often did behold
'The aged man that coffers-up his gold
Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
For they their guilt with weeping will unfold,
Will we find out; and there we will unfold
But now that fresh fair mirror, dim and old,
O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,
That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,
'But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,
Only to flatter fools and make them bold: 1610
Till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd
Where, lest between them both it should be kill'd,
'My daughter' and 'my wife' with clamours fill'd 1855
Poor women's faults, that they are so fulfill'd
Which she too early and too late hath spill'd.'
But chide rough winter that the flower hath kill'd:
Are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd.
I owed her, and 'tis mine that she hath kill'd.'
In Ajax' eyes blunt rage and rigor roll'd;
But none where all distress and dolour dwell'd,
To find a face where all distress is stell'd. 1495
Continuance tames the one; the other wild,
To tame the unicorn and lion wild,
So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
Is worthy blame. O, let it not be hild
'Were Tarquin Night, as he is but Night's child,
True grief is fond and testy as a child, 1145
To make the child a man, the man a child, 1005
Which virtue gave the golden age to gild
And to their hope they such odd action yield,
The coward captive vanquished doth yield
To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;
Their silver cheeks, and call'd it then their shield;
Which Tarquin view'd in her fair face's field,
From Venus' doves doth challenge that fair field:
When their brave hope, bold Hector, march'd to field,
Till she despairing Hecuba beheld,
Which struck her sad, and then it faster rock'd,
'And how her hand, in my hand being lock'd
A thousand crosses keep them from thy aid:
Weak words, so thick come in his poor heart's aid, 1835
But she, that yet her sad task hath not said, 1750
As well to hear as grant what he hath said.
That no man could distinguish what he said.
He gratis comes; and thou art well appaid 965
With untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid, 1265
'Madam, ere I was up,' replied the maid,
This Plot of death when sadly she had laid,
Each present lord began to promise aid,
Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd
In her the painter had anatomized
When with like semblance it is sympathized.
Her earnest eye did make him more amazed:
That two red fires in both their faces blazed; 1405
And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed;
Within whose face beauty and virtue strived
When at Collatium this false lord arrived,
'That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.
Thou wast not to this end from me derived.
Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived? 1805
The branches of another root are rotted,
For Collatine's dear love be kept unspotted:
And undeserved reproach to him allotted 875
Her sacred temple spotted, spoil'd, corrupted,
'Her house is sack'd, her quiet interrupted,
What could he see but mightily he noted?
What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,
Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted
'For even as subtle Sinon here is painted.
As if with grief or travail he had fainted,
The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
The fault unknown is as a thought unacted;
For lawful policy remains enacted.
This picture she advisedly perused,
Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused; 1580
And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.
Thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed,
Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed.
That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;
And when great treasure is the meed proposed,
But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed.
Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
Who this accomplishment so hotly chased;
By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased. 1885
And him by oath they truly honoured.
That wounds my body so dishonoured.
To think their dolour others have endured.
It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
Then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red,
And in his will his wilful eye he tired.
What did he note but strongly he desired?
With more than admiration he admired
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,
Here one being throng'd bears back, all boll'n and red;
By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;
To eat up errors by opinion bred,
So of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred;
For, after supper, long he questioned
That was not forced; that never was inclined
And what wrong else may be imagined
Stood for the whole to be imagined.
By reprobate desire thus madly led,
But beauty, in that white intituled,
By their high treason is his heart misled;
To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled,
To me came Tarquin armed; so beguiled 1595
With outward honesty, but yet defiled
Her twinkling handmaids too, by him defiled,
Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried;
Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,
Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.
In a pure compound; being so applied,
That she concludes the picture was belied.
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
His venom in effect is purified.
Blushing at that which is so putrified.
Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;
His rage of lust by gazing qualified;
O, had they in that darksome prison died!
Of that polluted prison where it breathed:
A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed: 1775
That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.
Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,
That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed.
What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;
Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
Mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?
Till Lucrece' father, that beholds her bleed,
Stone-still, astonish'd with this deadly deed,
That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed.
Let fair humanity abhor the deed
I know repentant tears ensue the deed,
When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?
The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;
All pure effects, and doth so far proceed,
With such black payment as thou hast pretended;
Mar not the thing that cannot be amended;
End thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended;
By this, lamenting Philomel had ended 1130
And solemn night with slow sad gait descended
True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
That through the length of times he stands disgraced:
Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,
Besides, his soul's fair temple is defaced;
Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed 1670
For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,
And now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed,
His wonted height, yet ere he go to bed,
Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.
The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece' bed.
And gazeth on her yet unstained bed.
O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!
That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.
At his own shadow let the thief run mad,
not requiring or staying for the people's suffrages, had
Such sweet observance in this work was had,
That dying fear through all her body spread;
Is madly toss'd between desire and dread;
Where thou was wont to rest thy weary head;
Here one man's hand lean'd on another's head,
Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
He pens her piteous clamours in her head;
Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head.
A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,
Show'd life imprison'd in a body dead.
